#### Demo

This website is built using Stitches, making use of all the features offered by the library. You can look at the code behind it to see how it's been created.

If you [look at the code on GitHub](https://github.com/modulz/stitches-site), you'll see that behind the scenes it's using components coming from the [Modulz design system](https://github.com/modulz/design-system).

All the components in the system are built using Stitches, and they support [tokens](/docs/tokens), [variants](/docs/variants), and a [dark theme](/docs/theming). Explore [their code implementation](https://github.com/modulz/design-system/tree/master/components), to find inspiration, ideas and design patterns on how to use Stitches in a real-world application.
