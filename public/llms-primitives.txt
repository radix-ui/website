# Radix Primitives - Complete Documentation

> Radix Primitives is an open-source React component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web applications. Components are unstyled, accessible, and customizable.

# Overview

## Accessibility

Radix Primitives follow the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and are tested in a wide selection of modern browsers and commonly used assistive technologies.

# Accessibility

Radix Primitives follow the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and are
tested in a wide selection of modern browsers and commonly used assistive
technologies.

We take care of many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including `aria` and `role` attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. That means that users should be able to use our components as-is in most contexts and rely on functionality to follow the expected accessibility design patterns.

## WAI-ARIA

[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/), published and maintained by the W3C, specifies the semantics for many common UI patterns that show up in Radix Primitives. This is designed to provide meaning for controls that aren't built using elements provided by the browser. For example, if you use a `div` instead of a `button` element to create a button, there are attributes you need to add to the `div` in order to convey that it's a button for screen readers or voice recognition tools.

In addition to semantics, there are behaviors that are expected from different types of components. A `button` element is going to respond to certain interactions in ways that a `div` will not, so it's up to the developer to reimplement those interactions with JavaScript. The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) provide additional guidance for implementing behaviors for various controls that come with Radix Primitives.

## Accessible Labels

With many built-in form controls, the native HTML `label` element is designed to provide semantic meaning and context for corresponding `input` elements. For non-form control elements, or for custom controls like those provided by Radix Primitives, [WAI-ARIA provides a specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#namecalculation) for how to provide accessible names and descriptions to those controls.

Where possible, Radix Primitives include abstractions to make labelling our controls simple. The [`Label`](../components/label) primitive is designed to work with many of our controls. Ultimately it's up to you to provide those labels so that users have the proper context when navigating your application.

## Keyboard Navigation

Many complex components, like [`Tabs`](../components/tabs) and [`Dialog`](../components/dialog), come with expectations from users on how to interact with their content using a keyboard or other non-mouse input modalities. Radix Primitives provide basic keyboard support in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).

## Focus Management

Proper keyboard navigation and good labelling often go hand-in-hand with managing focus. When a user interacts with an element and something changes as a result, it's often helpful to move focus with the interaction so that the next tab stop is logical depending on the new context of the app. And for screen reader users, moving focus often results in an announcement to convey this new context, which relies on proper labelling.

In many Radix Primitives, we move focus based on the interactions a user normally takes in a given component. For example, in [`AlertDialog`](../components/alert-dialog), when the modal is opened, focus is programmatically moved to a `Cancel` button element to anticipate a response to the prompt.

## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install and style the [Popover](../components/popover) component.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install Radix Primitives from your command line.

```bash
npm install radix-ui@latest
```

### 2. Import the parts

Import and structure the parts.

```jsx line=3,6-14
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>More info</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>
				Some more info…
				<Popover.Arrow />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

### 3. Add your styles

Add styles where desired.

```jsx line=4,8,10,12
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger __className__="PopoverTrigger">Show info</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">
				Some content
				<Popover.Arrow __className__="PopoverArrow" />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.PopoverTrigger {
	background-color: white;
	border-radius: 4px;
}

.PopoverContent {
	border-radius: 4px;
	padding: 20px;
	width: 260px;
	background-color: white;
}

.PopoverArrow {
	fill: white;
}
```

### Demo

Here's a complete demo.

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.

## Introduction

An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.

# Introduction

An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible
design systems and web apps.

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.

## Vision

Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion, checkbox,
combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI patterns are [documented by WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) and generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate. They're
either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customized sufficiently.

So, developers are forced to build custom components; an incredibly difficult task. As a
result, most components on the web are inaccessible, non-performant, and lacking important
features.

Our goal is to create a well-funded, open-source component library that the community can
use to build accessible design systems.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) where possible. We handle many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. Learn more in our [accessibility](./accessibility) overview.

### Unstyled

Components ship without styles, giving you complete control over the look and feel. Components can be styled with any styling solution. Learn more in our [styling](../guides/styling) guide.

### Opened

Radix Primitives are designed to be customized to suit your needs. Our open component architecture provides you granular access to each component part, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, or refs.

### Uncontrolled

Where applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can also be controlled, alternatively. All of the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible, without needing to create any local states.

### Developer experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consistent and predictable experience. We've also implemented an `asChild` prop, giving users full control over the rendered element.

### Incremental adoption

We recommend installing the `radix-ui` package and importing the primitives you need. This is the simplest way to get started, prevent version conflicts or duplication, and makes it easy to manage updates. The package is tree-shakeable, so you should only ship the components you use.

```bash
npm install radix-ui
```

```tsx
import { Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
```

Alternatively, each primitive can be installed individually:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

```tsx
import * as Dialog from "@radix-ui/react-dialog";
import * as DropdownMenu from "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu";
import * as Tooltip from "@radix-ui/react-tooltip";
```

When installing separately, we recommend updating all Radix packages together to prevent duplication of shared dependencies and keep your bundle size down.

## Releases

Radix Primitives releases and their changelogs.

# Releases

Radix Primitives releases and their changelogs.

## May 5, 2025

This release introduces a brand new primitive in preview: [`PasswordToggleField`](../components/password-toggle-field).

This new primitive provides components for rendering a password input alongside a button to toggle its visibility. Aside from its primary functionality, it also includes:

- Returning focus to the input when toggling with a pointer
- Maintaining focus when toggling with keyboard or virtual navigation
- Resetting visibility to hidden after form submission to prevent accidental storage
- Implicit accessible labeling for icon-based toggle buttons

This API is currently unstable, and we hope you'll help us test it out! Import the primitive using the `unstable_` prefix.

```tsx
import { unstable_PasswordToggleField as PasswordToggleField } from "radix-ui";

export function PasswordField() {
	return (
		<PasswordToggleField.Root>
			<PasswordToggleField.Input />
			<PasswordToggleField.Toggle>
				<PasswordToggleField.Icon
					visible={<EyeOpenIcon />}
					hidden={<EyeClosedIcon />}
				/>
			</PasswordToggleField.Toggle>
		</PasswordToggleField.Root>
	);
}
```

### Other updates

- Add unstable `Provider`, `Trigger` and `BubbleInput` parts to Checkbox ([#3459](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/3459))
- Update default input type to `text` and pass to the underlying input element ([#3510](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/3510))

## April 22, 2025

- Update the dependency for `use-sync-external-store` to ensure entrypoint is valid&#x20;

## April 17, 2025

This release introduces a brand new primitive in preview: [`OneTimePasswordField`](../components/one-time-password-field).

This new group of components are designed to implement a common design pattern for one-time password fields displayed as separate input fields for each character. This UI is deceptively complex to implement in such a way that interactions follow user expectations. The new primitive handles all of this complexity for you, including:

- Keyboard navigation mimicking the behavior of a single input field
- Overriding values on paste
- Password manager autofill support
- Input validation for numeric and alphanumeric values
- Auto-submit on completion
- Focus management
- Hidden input to provide a single value to form data

As this is a preview release, **the API is currently unstable**. We hope you'll help us test it out and let us know how it goes.

Import the primitive using the `unstable_` prefix.

```tsx
import { unstable_OneTimePasswordField as OneTimePasswordField } from "radix-ui";

export function Verify() {
	return (
		<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
		</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	);
}
```

### Other updates

- All form controls with internal bubble inputs now use the Radix `Primitive` component by default. This will allow us to expose these components in a future release so users can better control this behavior in the future.
- Minor improvements to `useControllableState` to enhance performance, reduce surface area for bugs, and log warnings when misused

## April 8, 2025

- Improved rendering performance for the Tooltip provider&#x20;
- Ensure Tooltip is closed when `pointerdown` is fired on the trigger&#x20;
- Add support for `crossOrigin` in Avatar images&#x20;
- Fix Avatar flashing when an image is already cached&#x20;
- Improve `displayName` for better debugging of slottable components&#x20;

## February 5, 2025

- Updated dependencies to remove peer dependency warnings for `react` and `react-dom`&#x20;
- Skip forwarding refs to `SlotClone` when the child is a `Fragment`&#x20;

## January 22, 2025

- Added a `radix-ui` package that exposes the latest version of all Radix Primitives from a single place. This tree-shakable entrypoint makes it easier to bring in whatever components you need and keep them up-to-date without worrying about conflicting or duplicate dependencies.
- Updated `aria-hidden` and `react-remove-scroll` dependencies for the following components:
  - Alert Dialog
  - Context Menu
  - Dialog
  - Dropdown Menu
  - Hover Card
  - Menubar
  - Navigation Menu
  - Popover
  - Select
  - Toast
  - Tooltip

With this release, we start following semantic versioning strictly. All primitives are now versioned .

We also move the [`Select`](../components/select), [`Toast`](../components/toast) and [`NavigationMenu`](../components/navigation-menu) from preview to stable.

- Improve support for React 18&#x20;
- **\[Breaking]** Improve RTL performance. You need to use [`DirectionProvider`](../utilities/direction-provider) if you were relying on `dir` attribute inheritance from document (or any element).&#x20;

* **\[Breaking]** Remove `allowPinchZoom` prop, now defaults to `true`&#x20;
* Improve compatibility with JS animation libraries with `forceMount` on `AlertDialog.Portal`&#x20;
* Fix regressions with page interactivity while/after closing dialog&#x20;

- **\[Breaking]** Remove `allowPinchZoom` prop, now defaults to `true`&#x20;
- **\[Breaking]** Add new `Portal` part. To avoid regressions, use this part if you want portalling behavior. Note that `z-index` isn't managed anymore so you have full control of layering.&#x20;
- **\[Breaking]** Remove `offset` on `Arrow` part&#x20;
- **\[Breaking]** Rename `collisionTolerance` to `collisionPadding` on `Content` part and accepts a number or a padding object&#x20;

* Add `aria-required` to root&#x20;

- `ScrollArea.Thumb` is now animatable&#x20;

* **\[Breaking]** Renamed `data-state` values from `active|inactive` to `checked|unchecked`&#x20;

# Guides

## Animation

Animate Radix Primitives with CSS keyframes or the JavaScript animation library of your choice.

# Animation

Animate Radix Primitives with CSS keyframes or the JavaScript animation
library of your choice.

Adding animation to Radix Primitives should feel similar to any other component, but there are some caveats noted here in regards to exiting animations with JS animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS animation

The simplest way to animate Primitives is with CSS.

You can use CSS animation to animate both mount and unmount phases. The latter is possible because the Radix Primitives will suspend unmount while your animation plays out.

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
	}
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
	from {
		opacity: 1;
	}
	to {
		opacity: 0;
	}
}

.DialogOverlay[data-state="open"],
.DialogContent[data-state="open"] {
	animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

.DialogOverlay[data-state="closed"],
.DialogContent[data-state="closed"] {
	animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in;
}
```

## Delegating unmounting for JavaScript Animation

When many stateful Primitives are hidden from view, they are actually removed from the React Tree, and their elements removed from the DOM. JavaScript animation libraries need control of the unmounting phase, so we provide the `forceMount` prop on many components to allow consumers to delegate the mounting and unmounting of children based on the animation state determined by those libraries.

For example, if you want to use React Spring to animate a `Dialog`, you would do so by conditionally rendering the dialog `Overlay` and `Content` parts based on the animation state from one of its hooks like `useTransition`:

```jsx
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";
import { useTransition, animated, config } from "react-spring";

function Example() {
	const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
	const transitions = useTransition(open, {
		from: { opacity: 0, y: -10 },
		enter: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
		leave: { opacity: 0, y: 10 },
		config: config.stiff,
	});
	return (
		<Dialog.Root open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
			<Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
			{transitions((styles, item) =>
				item ? (
					<>
						<Dialog.Overlay forceMount asChild>
							<animated.div
								style={{
									opacity: styles.opacity,
								}}
							/>
						</Dialog.Overlay>
						<Dialog.Content forceMount asChild>
							<animated.div style={styles}>
								<h1>Hello from inside the Dialog!</h1>
								<Dialog.Close>close</Dialog.Close>
							</animated.div>
						</Dialog.Content>
					</>
				) : null,
			)}
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
}
```

## Composition

Use the `asChild` prop to compose Radix's functionality onto alternative element types or your own React components.

# Composition

Use the `asChild` prop to compose Radix's functionality onto alternative
element types or your own React components.

All Radix primitive parts that render a DOM element accept an `asChild` prop. When `asChild` is set to `true`, Radix will not render a default DOM element, instead cloning the part's child and passing it the props and behavior required to make it functional.

## Changing the element type

In the majority of cases you shouldn’t need to modify the element type as Radix has been designed to provide the most appropriate defaults. However, there are cases where it is helpful to do so.

A good example is with `Tooltip.Trigger`. By default this part is rendered as a `button`, though you may want to add a tooltip to a link (`a` tag) as well. Let's see how you can achieve this using `asChild`:

```jsx line=7
import * as React from "react";
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger __asChild__>
			<a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/">Radix UI</a>
		</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Portal>…</Tooltip.Portal>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

> If you do decide to change the underlying element type, it is your responsibility to ensure it remains accessible and functional. In the case of `Tooltip.Trigger` for example, it must be a focusable element that can respond to pointer and keyboard events. If you were to switch it to a `div`, it would no longer be accessible.

In reality, you will rarely modify the underlying DOM element like we've seen above. Instead it's more common to use your own React components. This is especially true for most `Trigger` parts, as you usually want to compose the functionality with the custom buttons and links in your design system.

## Composing with your own React components

This works exactly the same as above, you pass `asChild` to the part and then wrap your own component with it.
However, there are a few gotchas to be aware of.

### Your component must spread props

When Radix clones your component, it will pass its own props and event handlers to make it functional and accessible. If your component doesn't support those props, it will break.

This is done by spreading all of the props onto the underlying DOM node.

```jsx line=5
// before
const MyButton = () => <button />;

// after
const MyButton = (props) => <button {...__props__} />;
```

We recommend always doing this so that you are not concerned with implementation details (ie. which props/events to accept). We find this is good practice for "leaf" components in general.

> Similarly to when changing the element type directly, it is your responsibility to ensure the element type rendered by your custom component remains accessible and functional.

### Your component must forward ref

Additionally, Radix will sometimes need to attach a `ref` to your component (for example to measure its size). If your component doesn't accept a `ref`, then it will break.

This is done using `React.forwardRef` (read more on [react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef)).

```jsx line=5-7
// before
const MyButton = (props) => <button {...props} />;

// after
const MyButton = __React.forwardRef__((props, __forwardedRef__) => (
	<button {...props} __ref__={__forwardedRef__} />
));
```

Whilst this isn't necessary for **all** parts, we recommend always doing it so that you are not concerned with implementation details. This is also generally good practice anyway for leaf components.

## Composing multiple primitives

`asChild` can be used as deeply as you need to. This means it is a great way to compose multiple primitive's behavior together.
Here is an example of how you can compose `Tooltip.Trigger` and `Dialog.Trigger` together with your own button:

```jsx line=12-16
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog, Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

const MyButton = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => (
	<button {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));

export default () => {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Tooltip.Root>
				<Tooltip.Trigger __asChild__>
					<Dialog.Trigger __asChild__>
						<MyButton>Open dialog</MyButton>
					</Dialog.Trigger>
				</Tooltip.Trigger>
				<Tooltip.Portal>…</Tooltip.Portal>
			</Tooltip.Root>

			<Dialog.Portal>...</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
};
```

## Server-side rendering

Radix Primitives can be rendered on the server. However, Primitives in React versions less than 18 rely on hydration for ids.

# Server-side rendering

Radix Primitives can be rendered on the server. However, Primitives in React
versions less than 18 rely on hydration for ids.

## Overview

Server-side rendering or `SSR`, is a technique used to render components to HTML on the server, as opposed to rendering them only on the client.

Static rendering is another similar approach. Instead it pre-renders pages to HTML at build time rather than on each request.

You should be able to use all of our primitives with both approaches, for example with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

## Gotcha

Primitives in React versions less than 18 rely on hydration for ids (used in aria attributes) to avoid server/client mismatch errors.

In other words, the equivalent of [Time to Interactive](https://web.dev/interactive/) for screen reader users will depend on the download speed of the JS bundle. If you'd like to generate ids server-side to improve this experience, we suggest upgrading to React 18.

## Styling

Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving you complete control over styling.

# Styling

Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving
you complete control over styling.

## Styling overview

### Functional styles

You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a [Dialog Overlay](../components/dialog) won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.

### Classes

All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/accordion) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.

## Styling with CSS

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targeting the `className` that you provide.

```jsx line=3,7
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const AccordionDemo = () => (
	<Accordion.Root>
		<Accordion.Item __className__="AccordionItem" value="item-1" />
		{/* … */}
	</Accordion.Root>
);

export default AccordionDemo;
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```css
.AccordionItem {
	border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.AccordionItem[__data-state__="open"] {
	border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

## Styling with CSS-in-JS

The examples below are using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), but you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.

### Styling a part

Most CSS-in-JS libraries export a function for passing components and their styles. You can provide the Radix primitive component directly.

```jsx line=5-7,11
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledItem = __styled__(Accordion.Item)`
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
`;

const AccordionDemo = () => (
	<Accordion.Root>
		<StyledItem value="item-1" />
		{/* … */}
	</Accordion.Root>
);

export default AccordionDemo;
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item)`
	border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;

	&[__data-state__="open"] {
		border-bottom-width: 2px;
	}
`;
```

## Extending a primitive

Extending a primitive is done the same way you extend any React component.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion as AccordionPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
	React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
	React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>((props, forwardedRef) => (
	<AccordionPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));
AccordionItem.displayName = "AccordionItem";
```

## Summary

Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.

For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.

# Components

## Accordion

A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content.

# Accordion

A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an
associated section of content.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-accordion
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Accordion.Root>
		<Accordion.Item>
			<Accordion.Header>
				<Accordion.Trigger />
			</Accordion.Header>
			<Accordion.Content />
		</Accordion.Item>
	</Accordion.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of an accordion.

### Item

Contains all the parts of a collapsible section.

### Header

Wraps an `Accordion.Trigger`. Use the `asChild` prop to update it to the appropriate heading level for your page.

### Trigger

Toggles the collapsed state of its associated item. It should be nested inside of an `Accordion.Header`.

### Content

Contains the collapsible content for an item.

## Examples

### Expanded by default

Use the `defaultValue` prop to define the open item by default.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root type="single" __defaultValue__="item-2">
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Allow collapsing all items

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow all items to close.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root type="single" __collapsible__>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Multiple items open at the same time

Set the `type` prop to `multiple` to enable opening multiple items at once.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root type="__multiple__">
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Rotated icon when open

You can add extra decorative elements, such as chevrons, and rotate it when the item is open.

```jsx line=12
// index.jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import { ChevronDownIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Accordion.Root type="single">
		<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
			<Accordion.Header>
				<Accordion.Trigger className="AccordionTrigger">
					<span>Trigger text</span>
					<ChevronDownIcon __className__="AccordionChevron" aria-hidden />
				</Accordion.Trigger>
			</Accordion.Header>
			<Accordion.Content>…</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Item>
	</Accordion.Root>
);
```

```css line=5-7
/* styles.css */
.AccordionChevron {
	transition: transform 300ms;
}
.AccordionTrigger[data-state="open"] > .AccordionChevron {
	transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

### Horizontal orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to create a horizontal accordion.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root __orientation__="horizontal">
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Animating content size

Use the `--radix-accordion-content-width` and/or `--radix-accordion-content-height` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it opens/closes:

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Accordion.Root type="single">
		<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
			<Accordion.Header>…</Accordion.Header>
			<Accordion.Content __className__="AccordionContent">…</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Item>
	</Accordion.Root>
);
```

```css line=21,27
/* styles.css */
.AccordionContent {
	overflow: hidden;
}
.AccordionContent[data-state="open"] {
	animation: slideDown 300ms ease-out;
}
.AccordionContent[data-state="closed"] {
	animation: slideUp 300ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		height: 0;
	}
	to {
		height: var(__--radix-accordion-content-height__);
	}
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		height: var(__--radix-accordion-content-height__);
	}
	to {
		height: 0;
	}
}
```

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-avatar
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Avatar } from "radix-ui";

		<Avatar.Fallback />
	</Avatar.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of an avatar.

### Image

The image to render. By default it will only render when it has loaded. You can use the `onLoadingStatusChange` handler if you need more control.

### Fallback

An element that renders when the image hasn't loaded. This means whilst it's loading, or if there was an error. If you notice a flash during loading, you can provide a `delayMs` prop to delay its rendering so it only renders for those with slower connections. For more control, use the `onLoadingStatusChange` handler on `Avatar.Image`.

## Examples

### Clickable Avatar with tooltip

You can compose the Avatar with a [Tooltip](/primitives/docs/components/tooltip) to display extra information.

```jsx line=1,4,5,7,9-13
import { Avatar, __Tooltip__ } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>
			<Avatar.Root>…</Avatar.Root>

```jsx line=5,9-14,16
import { DividerHorizontalIcon, CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Checkbox } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState("indeterminate");

	return (
		<>
			<StyledCheckbox checked={checked} onCheckedChange={setChecked}>
				<Checkbox.Indicator>
					{checked === "indeterminate" && <DividerHorizontalIcon />}
					{checked === true && <CheckIcon />}
				</Checkbox.Indicator>

## Examples

### With submenus

You can create submenus by using `ContextMenu.Sub` in combination with its parts.

```jsx line=8-17
<ContextMenu.Root>
	<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
	<ContextMenu.Portal>
		<ContextMenu.Content>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>

				</ContextMenu.Portal>
			</ContextMenu.Sub>
			<ContextMenu.Separator />
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
		</ContextMenu.Content>
	</ContextMenu.Portal>
</ContextMenu.Root>
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content>
				<ContextMenu.Item __className__="ContextMenuItem" __disabled__>
					…
				</ContextMenu.Item>
				<ContextMenu.Item className="ContextMenuItem">…</ContextMenu.Item>
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: gainsboro;
}
```

### With separators

Use the `Separator` part to add a separator between items.

```jsx line=6,8
<ContextMenu.Root>
	<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
	<ContextMenu.Portal>
		<ContextMenu.Content>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Separator />
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Separator />
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
		</ContextMenu.Content>
	</ContextMenu.Portal>
</ContextMenu.Root>
```

### With labels

Use the `Label` part to help label a section.

```jsx line=5
<ContextMenu.Root>
	<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
	<ContextMenu.Portal>
		<ContextMenu.Content>
			<ContextMenu.Label>Label</ContextMenu.Label>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
		</ContextMenu.Content>
	</ContextMenu.Portal>
</ContextMenu.Root>
```

### With checkbox items

Use the `CheckboxItem` part to add an item that can be checked.

```jsx line=6,16-21
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

	return (
		<ContextMenu.Root>
			<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
			<ContextMenu.Portal>
				<ContextMenu.Content>
					<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
					<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
					<ContextMenu.Separator />
					<ContextMenu.CheckboxItem
						checked={checked}
						onCheckedChange={setChecked}
					>
						<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							<CheckIcon />
						</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
						Checkbox item
					</ContextMenu.CheckboxItem>
				</ContextMenu.Content>
			</ContextMenu.Portal>
		</ContextMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With radio items

Use the `RadioGroup` and `RadioItem` parts to add an item that can be checked amongst others.

```jsx line=6,13-32
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [color, setColor] = React.useState("blue");

	return (
		<ContextMenu.Root>
			<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
			<ContextMenu.Portal>
				<ContextMenu.Content>
					<ContextMenu.RadioGroup value={color} onValueChange={setColor}>
						<ContextMenu.RadioItem value="red">
							<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Red
						</ContextMenu.RadioItem>
						<ContextMenu.RadioItem value="blue">
							<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Blue
						</ContextMenu.RadioItem>
						<ContextMenu.RadioItem value="green">
							<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Green
						</ContextMenu.RadioItem>
					</ContextMenu.RadioGroup>
				</ContextMenu.Content>
			</ContextMenu.Portal>
		</ContextMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With complex items

You can add extra decorative elements in the `Item` parts, such as images.

```jsx line=9,13
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content>
				<ContextMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Adolfo Hess
				</ContextMenu.Item>
				<ContextMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Miyah Myles
				</ContextMenu.Item>
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content/sub-content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content (or sub-content) so that it matches the trigger (or sub-trigger) width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-context-menu-trigger-width` and `--radix-context-menu-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content __className__="ContextMenuContent">
				…
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuContent {
	width: var(__--radix-context-menu-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-context-menu-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-context-menu-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content __className__="ContextMenuContent">
				…
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-context-menu-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content __className__="ContextMenuContent">
				…
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.ContextMenuContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.ContextMenuContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

		<Dialog.Trigger />
		<Dialog.Portal>
			<Dialog.Overlay />
			<Dialog.Content>
				<Dialog.Title />
				<Dialog.Description />
				<Dialog.Close />
			</Dialog.Content>
		</Dialog.Portal>
	</Dialog.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a dialog.

### Trigger

The button that opens the dialog.

### Portal

When used, portals your overlay and content parts into the `body`.

### Overlay

A layer that covers the inert portion of the view when the dialog is open.

### Content

Contains content to be rendered in the open dialog.

### Close

The button that closes the dialog.

### Title

An accessible title to be announced when the dialog is opened.

If you want to hide the title, wrap it inside our [Visually Hidden](../utilities/visually-hidden) utility like this `<VisuallyHidden asChild>`.

### Description

An optional accessible description to be announced when the dialog is opened.

If you want to hide the description, wrap it inside our [Visually Hidden](../utilities/visually-hidden) utility like this `<VisuallyHidden asChild>`. If you want to remove the description entirely, remove this part and pass `aria-describedby={undefined}` to `Dialog.Content`.

## Examples

### Close after asynchronous form submission

Use the controlled props to programmatically close the Dialog after an async operation has completed.

```jsx line=4,7,10,15,17
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";

const wait = () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

export default () => {
	const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

	return (
		<Dialog.Root __open__={open} __onOpenChange__={setOpen}>
			<Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Dialog.Overlay />
				<Dialog.Content>
					<form
						onSubmit={(event) => {
							wait().then(() => setOpen(false));
							event.preventDefault();
						}}
					>
						{/** some inputs */}
						<button type="submit">Submit</button>
					</form>
				</Dialog.Content>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
};
```

### Scrollable overlay

Move the content inside the overlay to render a dialog with overflow.

```jsx
// index.jsx
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Dialog.Trigger />
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Dialog.Overlay className="DialogOverlay">
					<Dialog.Content className="DialogContent">...</Dialog.Content>
				</Dialog.Overlay>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
};
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.DialogOverlay {
	background: rgba(0 0 0 / 0.5);
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	display: grid;
	place-items: center;
	overflow-y: auto;
}

.DialogContent {
	min-width: 300px;
	background: white;
	padding: 30px;
	border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Custom portal container

Customise the element that your dialog portals into.

```jsx line=5,10,16
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [container, setContainer] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<div>
			<Dialog.Root>
				<Dialog.Trigger />
				<Dialog.Portal __container__={container}>
					<Dialog.Overlay />
					<Dialog.Content>...</Dialog.Content>
				</Dialog.Portal>
			</Dialog.Root>

			<div ref={__setContainer__} />
		</div>
	);
};
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Dialog WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal).

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract the overlay and the close button

This example abstracts the `Dialog.Overlay` and `Dialog.Close` parts.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Dialog, DialogTrigger, DialogContent } from "./your-dialog";

export default () => (
	<Dialog>
		<DialogTrigger>Dialog trigger</DialogTrigger>
		<DialogContent>Dialog Content</DialogContent>
	</Dialog>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-dialog.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog as DialogPrimitive } from "radix-ui";
import { Cross1Icon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export const DialogContent = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => (
		<DialogPrimitive.Portal>
			<DialogPrimitive.Overlay />
			<DialogPrimitive.Content {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<DialogPrimitive.Close aria-label="Close">
					<Cross1Icon />
				</DialogPrimitive.Close>
			</DialogPrimitive.Content>
		</DialogPrimitive.Portal>
	),
);

export const Dialog = DialogPrimitive.Root;
export const DialogTrigger = DialogPrimitive.Trigger;
```

## Examples

### With submenus

You can create submenus by using `DropdownMenu.Sub` in combination with its parts.

```jsx line=8-17
<DropdownMenu.Root>
	<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
	<DropdownMenu.Portal>
		<DropdownMenu.Content>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>

						<DropdownMenu.Item>Sub menu item</DropdownMenu.Item>
						<DropdownMenu.Arrow />
					</DropdownMenu.SubContent>
				</DropdownMenu.Portal>
			</DropdownMenu.Sub>
			<DropdownMenu.Separator />
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
		</DropdownMenu.Content>
	</DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>
				<DropdownMenu.Item __className__="DropdownMenuItem" __disabled__>
					…
				</DropdownMenu.Item>
				<DropdownMenu.Item className="DropdownMenuItem">…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: gainsboro;
}
```

### With separators

Use the `Separator` part to add a separator between items.

```jsx line=6,8
<DropdownMenu.Root>
	<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
	<DropdownMenu.Portal>
		<DropdownMenu.Content>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Separator />
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Separator />
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
		</DropdownMenu.Content>
	</DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

### With labels

Use the `Label` part to help label a section.

```jsx line=5
<DropdownMenu.Root>
	<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
	<DropdownMenu.Portal>
		<DropdownMenu.Content>
			<DropdownMenu.Label>Label</DropdownMenu.Label>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
		</DropdownMenu.Content>
	</DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

### With checkbox items

Use the `CheckboxItem` part to add an item that can be checked.

```jsx line=6,16-21
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

	return (
		<DropdownMenu.Root>
			<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
			<DropdownMenu.Portal>
				<DropdownMenu.Content>
					<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
					<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
					<DropdownMenu.Separator />
					<DropdownMenu.CheckboxItem
						checked={checked}
						onCheckedChange={setChecked}
					>
						<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							<CheckIcon />
						</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
						Checkbox item
					</DropdownMenu.CheckboxItem>
				</DropdownMenu.Content>
			</DropdownMenu.Portal>
		</DropdownMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With radio items

Use the `RadioGroup` and `RadioItem` parts to add an item that can be checked amongst others.

```jsx line=6,13-32
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [color, setColor] = React.useState("blue");

	return (
		<DropdownMenu.Root>
			<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
			<DropdownMenu.Portal>
				<DropdownMenu.Content>
					<DropdownMenu.RadioGroup value={color} onValueChange={setColor}>
						<DropdownMenu.RadioItem value="red">
							<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Red
						</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
						<DropdownMenu.RadioItem value="blue">
							<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Blue
						</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
						<DropdownMenu.RadioItem value="green">
							<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Green
						</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
					</DropdownMenu.RadioGroup>
				</DropdownMenu.Content>
			</DropdownMenu.Portal>
		</DropdownMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With complex items

You can add extra decorative elements in the `Item` parts, such as images.

```jsx line=9,13
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>
				<DropdownMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Adolfo Hess
				</DropdownMenu.Item>
				<DropdownMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Miyah Myles
				</DropdownMenu.Item>
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content/sub-content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content (or sub-content) so that it matches the trigger (or sub-trigger) width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-dropdown-menu-trigger-width` and `--radix-dropdown-menu-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content __className__="DropdownMenuContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuContent {
	width: var(__--radix-dropdown-menu-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-dropdown-menu-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-dropdown-menu-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content __className__="DropdownMenuContent">
				…
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-dropdown-menu-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content __className__="DropdownMenuContent">
				…
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.DropdownMenuContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.DropdownMenuContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Menu Button WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu-button/) and uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex) to manage focus movement among menu items.

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract the arrow and item indicators

This example abstracts the `DropdownMenu.Arrow` and `DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator` parts. It also wraps implementation details for `CheckboxItem` and `RadioItem`.

#### Usage

```jsx
import {
	DropdownMenu,
	DropdownMenuTrigger,
	DropdownMenuContent,
	DropdownMenuLabel,
	DropdownMenuItem,
	DropdownMenuGroup,
	DropdownMenuCheckboxItem,
	DropdownMenuRadioGroup,
	DropdownMenuRadioItem,
	DropdownMenuSeparator,
} from "./your-dropdown-menu";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu>
		<DropdownMenuTrigger>DropdownMenu trigger</DropdownMenuTrigger>
		<DropdownMenuContent>
			<DropdownMenuItem>Item</DropdownMenuItem>
			<DropdownMenuLabel>Label</DropdownMenuLabel>
			<DropdownMenuGroup>Group</DropdownMenuGroup>
			<DropdownMenuCheckboxItem>CheckboxItem</DropdownMenuCheckboxItem>
			<DropdownMenuSeparator>Separator</DropdownMenuSeparator>
			<DropdownMenuRadioGroup>
				<DropdownMenuRadioItem>RadioItem</DropdownMenuRadioItem>
				<DropdownMenuRadioItem>RadioItem</DropdownMenuRadioItem>
			</DropdownMenuRadioGroup>
		</DropdownMenuContent>
	</DropdownMenu>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-dropdown-menu.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { DropdownMenu as DropdownMenuPrimitive } from "radix-ui";
import { CheckIcon, DividerHorizontalIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export const DropdownMenu = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Root;
export const DropdownMenuTrigger = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Trigger;

export const DropdownMenuContent = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<DropdownMenuPrimitive.Portal>
				<DropdownMenuPrimitive.Content {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
					{children}
					<DropdownMenuPrimitive.Arrow />
				</DropdownMenuPrimitive.Content>
			</DropdownMenuPrimitive.Portal>
		);
	},
);

export const DropdownMenuLabel = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Label;
export const DropdownMenuItem = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Item;
export const DropdownMenuGroup = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Group;

export const DropdownMenuCheckboxItem = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<DropdownMenuPrimitive.CheckboxItem {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
					{props.checked === "indeterminate" && <DividerHorizontalIcon />}
					{props.checked === true && <CheckIcon />}
				</DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
			</DropdownMenuPrimitive.CheckboxItem>
		);
	},
);

export const DropdownMenuRadioGroup = DropdownMenuPrimitive.RadioGroup;

export const DropdownMenuRadioItem = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<DropdownMenuPrimitive.RadioItem {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
					<CheckIcon />
				</DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
			</DropdownMenuPrimitive.RadioItem>
		);
	},
);

export const DropdownMenuSeparator = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Separator;
```

## Form

Collect information from your users using validation rules.

# Form

Collect information from your users using validation rules.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-form
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Form } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Form.Root>
		<Form.Field>
			<Form.Label />
			<Form.Control />
			<Form.Message />
			<Form.ValidityState />
		</Form.Field>

		<Form.Message />
		<Form.ValidityState />

		<Form.Submit />
	</Form.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a form.

### Field

The wrapper for a field. It handles id/name and label accessibility automatically.

### Label

A label element which is automatically wired when nested inside a `Field` part.

### Control

A control element (by default an `input`) which is automatically wired when nested inside a `Field` part.

### Message

A validation message which is automatically wired (functionality and accessibility) to a given control when nested inside a `Field` part. It can be used for built-in and custom client-side validation, as well as server-side validation. When used outside a `Field` you must pass a `name` prop matching a field.

`Form.Message` accepts a `match` prop which is used to determine when the message should show. It matches the native HTML validity state (`ValidityState` on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState)) which validates against attributes such as `required`, `min`, `max`. The message will show if the given `match` is `true` on the control’s validity state.

You can also pass a function to `match` to provide custom validation rules.

### ValidityState

Use this render-prop component to access a given field’s validity state in render (see `ValidityState` on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState)). A field's validity is available automatically when nested inside a `Field` part, otherwise you must pass a `name` prop to associate it.

### Submit

The submit button.

## Examples

### Composing with your own components

Using `asChild` you can compose the `Form` primitive parts with your own components.

```jsx line=3
<Form.Field name="name">
	<Form.Label>Full name</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control __asChild__>
		<TextField.Input variant="primary" />
	</Form.Control>
</Form.Field>
```

It can also be used to compose other types of controls, such as a `select`:

```jsx line=3
<Form.Field name="country">
	<Form.Label>Country</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control __asChild__>
		<select>
			<option value="uk">United Kingdom</option>…
		</select>
	</Form.Control>
</Form.Field>
```

> Note: At the moment, it is not possible to compose `Form` with Radix's other form primitives such as `Checkbox`, `Select`, etc. We are working on a solution for this.

### Providing your own validation messages

When no `children` are provided, `Form.Message` will render a default error message for the given `match`.

```jsx
// will yield "This value is missing"
<Form.Message match="valueMissing" />
```

You can provide a more meaningful message by passing your own `children`. This is also useful for internationalization.

```jsx
// will yield "Please provide a name"
<Form.Message match="valueMissing">__Please provide a name__</Form.Message>
```

### Custom validation

On top of all the built-in client-side validation matches described above you can also provide your own custom validation whilst still making use of the platform's validation abilities. It uses the `customError` type present in the [constraint validition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation).

You can pass your own validation function into the `match` prop on `Form.Message`. Here's an example:

```jsx line=4
<Form.Field name="name">
	<Form.Label>Full name</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control />
	<Form.Message __match__={(value, formData) => value !== "John"}>
		Only John is allowed.
	</Form.Message>
</Form.Field>
```

> `match` will be called with the current value of the control as first argument and the entire `FormData` as second argument.
> `match` can also be an `async` function (or return a promise) to perform async validation.

### Styling based on validity

We add `data-valid` and `data-invalid` attributes to the relevant parts. Use it to style your components accordingly.
Here is an example styling the `Label` part.

```jsx line=8
//index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Form } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Form.Root>
		<Form.Field name="email">
			<Form.Label __className__="FormLabel">Email</Form.Label>
			<Form.Control type="email" />
		</Form.Field>
	</Form.Root>
);
```

```css line=2,5
/* styles.css */
.FormLabel[__data-invalid__] {
	color: red;
}
.FormLabel[__data-valid__] {
	color: green;
}
```

### Accessing the validity state for more control

You may need to access the raw validity state of a field in order to display your own icons, or interface with a component library via it's defined props. You can do this by using the `Form.ValidityState` part:

```jsx line=3-4,7-8
<Form.Field name="name">
	<Form.Label>Full name</Form.Label>
	<Form.ValidityState>
		{(validity) => (
			<Form.Control asChild>
				<TextField.Input
					variant="primary"
					state={getTextFieldInputState(__validity__)}
				/>
			</Form.Control>
		)}
	</Form.ValidityState>
</Form.Field>
```

### Server-side validation

The component also supports server-side validation using the same `Form.Message` component.
You can re-use the same messages you defined for client-side errors by passing a `forceMatch` prop which will force the message to show regardless of the client-side matching logic.

If the message doesn't exist on the client-side, you can render a `Form.Message` without a `match` too.
The field is marked as invalid by passing a `serverInvalid` boolean prop to the `Form.Field` part.

Here's an example with server-side error handling:

```jsx line=5-8,13,23,28-30,49-54
import * as React from "react";
import { Form } from "radix-ui";

function Page() {
	const [serverErrors, setServerErrors] = React.useState({
		email: false,
		password: false,
	});

	return (
		<Form.Root
			// `onSubmit` only triggered if it passes client-side validation
			onSubmit={(event) => {
				const data = Object.fromEntries(new FormData(event.currentTarget));

				// Submit form data and catch errors in the response
				submitForm(data)
					.then(() => {})
					/**
					 * Map errors from your server response into a structure you'd like to work with.
					 * In this case resulting in this object: `{ email: false, password: true }`
					 */
					.catch((errors) => __setServerErrors__(mapServerErrors(errors)));

				// prevent default form submission
				event.preventDefault();
			}}
			onClearServerErrors={() =>
				__setServerErrors__({ email: false, password: false })
			}
		>
			<Form.Field name="email" __serverInvalid__={serverErrors.email}>
				<Form.Label>Email address</Form.Label>
				<Form.Control type="email" required />
				<Form.Message match="valueMissing">
					Please enter your email.
				</Form.Message>
				<Form.Message match="typeMismatch" __forceMatch__={serverErrors.email}>
					Please provide a valid email.
				</Form.Message>
			</Form.Field>

			<Form.Field name="password" __serverInvalid__={serverErrors.password}>
				<Form.Label>Password</Form.Label>
				<Form.Control type="password" required />
				<Form.Message match="valueMissing">
					Please enter a password.
				</Form.Message>
				{serverErrors.password && (
					<Form.Message>
						Please provide a valid password. It should contain at least 1 number
						and 1 special character.
					</Form.Message>
				)}
			</Form.Field>

			<Form.Submit>Submit</Form.Submit>
		</Form.Root>
	);
}
```

You should clear the server errors using the `onClearServerErrors` callback prop on the `Form.Root` part. It will clear the server errors before the form is re-submitted, and when the form is reset.

In addition, this provides control over when to reset single server errors. For example you could reset the email server error as soon as the user edits it:

```jsx line=3
<Form.Field name="email" serverInvalid={serverErrors.email}>
	<Form.Label>Email address</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control
		type="email"
		__onChange__={() => setServerErrors((prev) => ({ ...prev, email: false }))}
	/>
	<Form.Message match="valueMissing">Please enter your email.</Form.Message>
	<Form.Message match="typeMismatch" forceMatch={serverErrors.email}>
		Please provide a valid email.
	</Form.Message>
</Form.Field>
```

## Accessibility

The component follows the "inline errors" pattern for validation:

- Label and control are associated using the `name` provided on `Form.Field`
- When one or more client-side error messages display, they are automatically associated with their matching control and announced accordingly
- Focus is moved to the first invalid control

For sighted users to preview content available behind a link.

# Hover Card

For sighted users to preview content available behind a link.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-hover-card
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger />
		<HoverCard.Portal>
			<HoverCard.Content>
				<HoverCard.Arrow />
			</HoverCard.Content>
		</HoverCard.Portal>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a hover card.

### Trigger

The link that opens the hover card when hovered.

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the hover card is open.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the hover card. This can be used to help visually link the trigger with the `HoverCard.Content`. Must be rendered inside `HoverCard.Content`.

## Examples

### Show instantly

Use the `openDelay` prop to control the time it takes for the hover card to open.

```jsx line=4
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root __openDelay__={0}>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Content>…</HoverCard.Content>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-hover-card-trigger-width` and `--radix-hover-card-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Portal>
			<HoverCard.Content __className__="HoverCardContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</HoverCard.Content>
		</HoverCard.Portal>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.HoverCardContent {
	width: var(__--radix-hover-card-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-hover-card-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-hover-card-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Content __className__="HoverCardContent">…</HoverCard.Content>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.HoverCardContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-hover-card-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Content __className__="HoverCardContent">…</HoverCard.Content>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.HoverCardContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.HoverCardContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.HoverCardContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

The hover card is intended for sighted users only, the content will be inaccessible to keyboard users.

			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Menu>
</Menubar.Root>
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=11
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content>
					<Menubar.Item __className__="MenubarItem" __disabled__>

	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.MenubarItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: gainsboro;
}
```

### With separators

```jsx line=7,9
<Menubar.Root>
	<Menubar.Menu>
		<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
		<Menubar.Portal>
			<Menubar.Content>
				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
				<Menubar.Separator />
				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>

				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Menu>
</Menubar.Root>
```

### With labels

Use the `Label` part to help label a section.

```jsx line=6
<Menubar.Root>

				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Menu>
</Menubar.Root>
```

### With checkbox items

Use the `CheckboxItem` part to add an item that can be checked.

```jsx line=6,17-22
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

	return (
		<Menubar.Root>
			<Menubar.Menu>
				<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
				<Menubar.Portal>
					<Menubar.Content>
						<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
						<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
						<Menubar.Separator />
						<Menubar.CheckboxItem
							checked={checked}
							onCheckedChange={setChecked}
						>
							<Menubar.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</Menubar.ItemIndicator>
							Checkbox item
						</Menubar.CheckboxItem>
					</Menubar.Content>
				</Menubar.Portal>
			</Menubar.Menu>
		</Menubar.Root>
	);
};
```

### With radio items

Use the `RadioGroup` and `RadioItem` parts to add an item that can be checked amongst others.

```jsx line=6,14-27
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [color, setColor] = React.useState("blue");

	return (
		<Menubar.Root>
			<Menubar.Menu>
				<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
				<Menubar.Portal>
					<Menubar.Content>
						<Menubar.RadioGroup value={color} onValueChange={setColor}>

								<Menubar.ItemIndicator>
									<CheckIcon />
								</Menubar.ItemIndicator>
								Red
							</Menubar.RadioItem>
							<Menubar.RadioItem value="blue">
								<Menubar.ItemIndicator>
									<CheckIcon />
								</Menubar.ItemIndicator>
								Blue
							</Menubar.RadioItem>
						</Menubar.RadioGroup>
					</Menubar.Content>
				</Menubar.Portal>
			</Menubar.Menu>
		</Menubar.Root>
	);
};
```

### With complex items

You can add extra decorative elements in the `Item` parts, such as images.

```jsx line=10,14
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content>
					<Menubar.Item>
						<img src="…" />
						Adolfo Hess
					</Menubar.Item>
					<Menubar.Item>
						<img src="…" />
						Miyah Myles
					</Menubar.Item>
				</Menubar.Content>
			</Menubar.Portal>
		</Menubar.Menu>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content/sub-content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content (or sub-content) so that it matches the trigger (or sub-trigger) width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-menubar-trigger-width` and `--radix-menubar-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
		<Menubar.Portal>
			<Menubar.Content __className__="MenubarContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.MenubarContent {
	width: var(__--radix-menubar-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-menubar-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-menubar-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content __className__="MenubarContent">…</Menubar.Content>
			</Menubar.Portal>
		</Menubar.Menu>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.MenubarContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-menubar-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content __className__="MenubarContent">…</Menubar.Content>
			</Menubar.Portal>
		</Menubar.Menu>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.MenubarContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.MenubarContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.MenubarContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Menu Button WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu-button/) and uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex) to manage focus movement among menu items.

# Navigation Menu

A collection of links for navigating websites.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-navigation-menu
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger />
				<NavigationMenu.Content>
					<NavigationMenu.Link />
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Link />
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Item>

				<NavigationMenu.Content>
					<NavigationMenu.Sub>
						<NavigationMenu.List />
						<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
					</NavigationMenu.Sub>
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Indicator />
		</NavigationMenu.List>

		<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a navigation menu.

### Sub

Signifies a submenu. Use it in place of the root part when nested to create a submenu.

### List

Contains the top level menu items.

### Item

A top level menu item, contains a link or trigger with content combination.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the content.

### Content

Contains the content associated with each trigger.

### Link

A navigational link.

### Indicator

An optional indicator element that renders below the list, is used to highlight the currently active trigger.

### Viewport

An optional viewport element that is used to render active content outside of the list.

## Examples

### Vertical

You can create a vertical menu by using the `orientation` prop.

```jsx line=1
<NavigationMenu.Root __orientation__="vertical">
	<NavigationMenu.List>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item Two content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
	</NavigationMenu.List>
</NavigationMenu.Root>
```

### Flexible layouts

Use the `Viewport` part when you need extra control over where `Content` is rendered. This can be helpful when your design
requires an adjusted DOM structure or if you need flexibility to achieve [advanced animation](/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu#advanced-animation).
Tab focus will be maintained automatically.

```jsx line=14
<NavigationMenu.Root>
	<NavigationMenu.List>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item two content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
	</NavigationMenu.List>

	{/* NavigationMenu.Content will be rendered here when active */}
	<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
</NavigationMenu.Root>
```

### With indicator

You can use the optional `Indicator` part to highlight the currently active `Trigger`, this is useful when you want to provide
an animated visual cue such as an arrow or highlight to accompany the `Viewport`.

```jsx line=17
// index.jsx
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content>Item two content</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Indicator __className__="NavigationMenuIndicator" />
		</NavigationMenu.List>

		<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.NavigationMenuIndicator {
	background-color: grey;
}
.NavigationMenuIndicator[data-orientation="horizontal"] {
	height: 3px;
	transition:
		width,
		transform,
		250ms ease;
}
```

### With submenus

Create a submenu by nesting your `NavigationMenu` and using the `Sub` part in place of its `Root`.
Submenus work differently to `Root` navigation menus and are similar to [`Tabs`](/primitives/docs/components/tabs) in that one item should always be active, so be
sure to assign and set a `defaultValue`.

```jsx line=10,25
<NavigationMenu.Root>
	<NavigationMenu.List>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>
				<NavigationMenu.__Sub__ __defaultValue__="sub1">
					<NavigationMenu.List>
						<NavigationMenu.Item value="sub1">
							<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Sub item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
							<NavigationMenu.Content>
								Sub item one content
							</NavigationMenu.Content>
						</NavigationMenu.Item>
						<NavigationMenu.Item value="sub2">
							<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Sub item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
							<NavigationMenu.Content>
								Sub item two content
							</NavigationMenu.Content>
						</NavigationMenu.Item>
					</NavigationMenu.List>
				</NavigationMenu.__Sub__>
			</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
	</NavigationMenu.List>
</NavigationMenu.Root>
```

### With client side routing

If you need to use the `Link` component provided by your routing package then we recommend composing with `NavigationMenu.Link` via a custom component.
This will ensure accessibility and consistent keyboard control is maintained. Here's an example using Next.js:

```jsx line=7-16,22,25
// index.jsx
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import NextLink from "next/link";
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const Link = ({ href, ...props }) => {
	const pathname = usePathname();
	const isActive = href === pathname;

	return (
		<NavigationMenu.Link asChild active={isActive}>
			<NextLink href={href} className="NavigationMenuLink" {...props} />
		</NavigationMenu.Link>
	);
};

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<Link href="/">Home</Link>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<Link href="/about">About</Link>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
		</NavigationMenu.List>
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.NavigationMenuLink {
	text-decoration: none;
}
.NavigationMenuLink[data-active] {
	text-decoration: "underline";
}
```

### Advanced animation

We expose `--radix-navigation-menu-viewport-[width|height]` and `data-motion['from-start'|'to-start'|'from-end'|'to-end']` attributes
to allow you to animate `Viewport` size and `Content` position based on the enter/exit direction.

Combining these with `position: absolute;` allows you to create smooth overlapping animation effects when moving between items.

```jsx line=10-12,16-18,22
// index.jsx
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content __className__="NavigationMenuContent">
					Item one content
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content __className__="NavigationMenuContent">
					Item two content
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
		</NavigationMenu.List>

		<NavigationMenu.Viewport __className__="NavigationMenuViewport" />
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=9-20,24,25
/* styles.css */
.NavigationMenuContent {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	animation-duration: 250ms;
	animation-timing-function: ease;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="from-start"] {
	animation-name: enterFromLeft;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="from-end"] {
	animation-name: enterFromRight;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="to-start"] {
	animation-name: exitToLeft;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="to-end"] {
	animation-name: exitToRight;
}

.NavigationMenuViewport {
	position: relative;
	width: var(__--radix-navigation-menu-viewport-width__);
	height: var(__--radix-navigation-menu-viewport-height__);
	transition:
		width,

		250ms ease;
}

@keyframes enterFromRight {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateX(200px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
}

@keyframes enterFromLeft {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateX(-200px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
}

@keyframes exitToRight {
	from {

		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
	to {

		transform: translateX(-200px);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [`navigation` role requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#navigation).

### Differences to menubar

`NavigationMenu` should not be confused with `menubar`, although this primitive shares the name `menu` in the colloquial sense to refer to a set of navigation links, it does not use the WAI-ARIA `menu` role.
This is because `menu` and `menubars` behave like native operating system menus most commonly found in desktop application windows, as such they feature complex functionality like composite focus management and first-character navigation.

These features are often considered [unnecessary for website navigation](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/353) and at worst can confuse users who are familiar with established website patterns.

See the W3C [Disclosure Navigation Menu](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/disclosure/disclosure-navigation.html) example for more information.

### Link usage and aria-current

It's important to use `NavigationMenu.Link` for all navigational links within a menu, this not only applies to the main list
but also within any content rendered via `NavigationMenu.Content`. This will ensure consistent keyboard interactions and accessibility
while also giving access to the `active` prop for setting `aria-current` and the active styles.
See [this example](/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu#with-client-side-routing) for more information on usage with third party routing components.

## One-Time Password Field

A group of single-character text inputs to handle one-time password verification

# One-Time Password Field

A group of single-character text inputs to handle one-time password
verification.

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { unstable_OneTimePasswordField as OneTimePasswordField } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
		{/* one Input for each character of the value */}
		<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
		{/* single HiddenInput to store the full value */}
		<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
	</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a one-time password field.

### Input

Renders a text input representing a single character in the value.

### HiddenInput

## Examples

### Basic usage

```jsx
// This will render a field with 6 inputs, for use with
// 6-character passwords. Render an Input component for
// each character of accepted password's length.
<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
```

### Segmented controls

The `Root` component accepts arbitrary children, so rendering a visually segmented list is as simple as rendering separators between inputs. We recommend hiding decorative elements from assistive tech with `aria-hidden` and avoid rendering other meaningful content within `Root` since each child element is expected to belong to the parent with the `group` role.

```jsx line=3,5,7
<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<Separator.Root aria-hidden />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<Separator.Root aria-hidden />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<Separator.Root aria-hidden />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
```

### Auto-submit form when password is entered

Use the `autoSubmit` prop to submit an associated form when all inputs are filled.

```jsx
function Verify({ validCode }) {
	const PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6;
	function handleSubmit(event) {
		event.preventDefault();
		const formData = event.formData;
		if (formData.get("otp") === validCode) {
			redirect("/authenticated");
		} else {
			window.alert("Invalid code");
		}
	}
	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<OneTimePasswordField.Root name="otp" autoSubmit>
				{PASSWORD_LENGTH.map((_, i) => (
					<OneTimePasswordField.Input key={i} />
				))}
				{/* HiddenInput is required for the form to have data associated with the field */}
				<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
			</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
			<button>Submit</button>
		</form>
	);
}
```

### Controlled value

```jsx
function Verify({ validCode }) {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");
	const PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6;
	function handleSubmit() {
		if (value === validCode) {
			redirect("/authenticated");
		} else {
			window.alert("Invalid code");
		}
	}
	return (
		<OneTimePasswordField.Root
			autoSubmit
			value={value}
			onAutoSubmit={handleSubmit}
			onValueChange={setValue}
		>
			{PASSWORD_LENGTH.map((_, i) => (
				<OneTimePasswordField.Input key={i} />
			))}
		</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	);
}
```

## Accessibility

At the time of writing, there is no singular established pattern in WCAG guidelines for implementing one-time password fields as separate inputs. The behavior aims to get as close as possible to having the field act as a single input, with a few exceptions to match user expectations based on our initial research, testing, and gathering feedback.

This component is implemented as `input` elements within a container with a role of `group` to indicate that child inputs are related. Inputs can be navigated and focused using direction keys, and typing input will move focus to the next input until the last input is reached.

Pasting a value into the field will replace the contents of all inputs, regardless of the currently focused input. Based on our research this seems to align with most user expectations, where values are often pasted from password-managers or an email.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger />
		<Popover.Anchor />
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>
				<Popover.Close />
				<Popover.Arrow />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a popover.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the popover. By default, the `Popover.Content` will position itself against the trigger.

### Anchor

An optional element to position the `Popover.Content` against. If this part is not used, the content will position alongside the .

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the popover is open.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the popover. This can be used to help visually link the anchor with the `Popover.Content`. Must be rendered inside `Popover.Content`.

### Close

The button that closes an open popover.

## Examples

### Constrain the content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-popover-trigger-width` and `--radix-popover-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>…</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.PopoverContent {
	width: var(__--radix-popover-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-popover-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-popover-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>…</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">…</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.PopoverContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-popover-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>…</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">…</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.PopoverContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.PopoverContent[__data-side__="top"] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.PopoverContent[__data-side__="bottom"] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

### With custom anchor

You can anchor the content to another element if you do not want to use the trigger as the anchor.

```jsx line=7-11
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Anchor __asChild__>
			<div className="Row">
				Row as anchor <Popover.Trigger>Trigger</Popover.Trigger>
			</div>
		</Popover.Anchor>

		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>…</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.Row {
	background-color: gainsboro;
	padding: 20px;
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Dialog WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal).

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

#### Abstract the arrow and set default configuration

This example abstracts the `Popover.Arrow` part and sets a default `sideOffset` configuration.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Popover, PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent } from "./your-popover";

export default () => (
	<Popover>
		<PopoverTrigger>Popover trigger</PopoverTrigger>
		<PopoverContent>Popover content</PopoverContent>
	</Popover>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-popover.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover as PopoverPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
export const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;

export const PopoverContent = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => (
		<PopoverPrimitive.Portal>
			<PopoverPrimitive.Content sideOffset={5} {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<PopoverPrimitive.Arrow />
			</PopoverPrimitive.Content>
		</PopoverPrimitive.Portal>
	),
);
```

# Radio Group

A set of checkable buttons—known as radio buttons—where no more than one of
the buttons can be checked at a time.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-radio-group
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { RadioGroup } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<RadioGroup.Root>
		<RadioGroup.Item>
			<RadioGroup.Indicator />
		</RadioGroup.Item>
	</RadioGroup.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a radio group.

### Item

An item in the group that can be checked. An `input` will also render when used within a `form` to ensure events propagate correctly.

### Indicator

Renders when the radio item is in a checked state. You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Radio Group WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio) and uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/examples/radio) to manage focus movement among radio items.

```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { ScrollArea } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<ScrollArea.Root>
		<ScrollArea.Viewport />
		<ScrollArea.Scrollbar orientation="horizontal">
			<ScrollArea.Thumb />
		</ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
		<ScrollArea.Scrollbar orientation="vertical">
			<ScrollArea.Thumb />
		</ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
		<ScrollArea.Corner />
	</ScrollArea.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a scroll area.

### Viewport

The viewport area of the scroll area.

### Scrollbar

The vertical scrollbar. Add a second `Scrollbar` with an `orientation` prop to enable horizontal scrolling.

### Thumb

The thumb to be used in `ScrollArea.Scrollbar`.

### Corner

The corner where both vertical and horizontal scrollbars meet.

## Accessibility

In most cases, it's best to rely on native scrolling and work with the customization options available in CSS. When that isn't enough, `ScrollArea` provides additional customizability while maintaining the browser's native scroll behavior (as well as accessibility features, like keyboard scrolling).

### Keyboard Interactions

Scrolling via keyboard is supported by default because the component relies on native scrolling. Specific keyboard interactions may differ between platforms, so we do not specify them here or add specific event listeners to handle scrolling via key events.

```jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Value />
			<Select.Icon />
		</Select.Trigger>

		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.ScrollUpButton />
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item>
						<Select.ItemText />

					<Select.Separator />
				</Select.Viewport>
				<Select.ScrollDownButton />
				<Select.Arrow />
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a select.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the select. The `Select.Content` will position itself by aligning over the trigger.

### Value

The part that reflects the selected value. By default the selected item's text will be rendered. if you require more control, you can instead control the select and pass your own `children`. It should not be styled to ensure correct positioning. An optional `placeholder` prop is also available for when the select has no value.

### Icon

A small icon often displayed next to the value as a visual affordance for the fact it can be open. By default renders ▼ but you can use your own icon via `asChild` or use `children`.

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the select is open.

### Viewport

The scrolling viewport that contains all of the items.

### Item

The component that contains the select items.

### ItemText

The textual part of the item. It should only contain the text you want to see in the trigger when that item is selected. It should not be styled to ensure correct positioning.

### ItemIndicator

Renders when the item is selected. You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

### ScrollUpButton

An optional button used as an affordance to show the viewport overflow as well as functionaly enable scrolling upwards.

### ScrollDownButton

An optional button used as an affordance to show the viewport overflow as well as functionaly enable scrolling downwards.

### Group

Used to group multiple items. use in conjunction with `Select.Label` to ensure good accessibility via automatic labelling.

### Label

Used to render the label of a group. It won't be focusable using arrow keys.

### Separator

Used to visually separate items in the select.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the content. This can be used to help visually link the trigger with the `Select.Content`. Must be rendered inside `Select.Content`. Only available when `position` is set to `popper`.

## Examples

### Change the positioning mode

By default, `Select` will behave similarly to a native MacOS menu by positioning `Select.Content` relative to the active item. If you would prefer an alternative positioning approach similar to `Popover` or `DropdownMenu` then you can set `position` to `popper` and make use of additional alignment options such as `side`, `sideOffset` and more.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content __position__="popper" __sideOffset__={5}>
				…
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content size

When using `position="popper"` on `Select.Content`, you may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-select-trigger-width` and `--radix-select-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content
				__className__="SelectContent"
				position="popper"
				sideOffset={5}
			>
				…
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.SelectContent {
	width: var(__--radix-select-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-select-content-available-height__);
}
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=11
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item __className__="SelectItem" __disabled__>
						…
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				</Select.Viewport>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.SelectItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: "gainsboro";
}
```

### With a placeholder

You can use the `placeholder` prop on `Value` for when the select has no value. There's also a `data-placeholder` attribute on `Trigger` to help with styling.

```jsx line=7,8
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger __className__="SelectTrigger">
			<Select.Value __placeholder__="Pick an option" />
			<Select.Icon />
		</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>…</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.SelectTrigger[__data-placeholder__] {
	color: "gainsboro";
}
```

### With separators

Use the `Separator` part to add a separator between items.

```jsx line=9
<Select.Root>
	<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
	<Select.Portal>
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Viewport>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Separator />
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
			</Select.Viewport>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Portal>
</Select.Root>
```

### With grouped items

Use the `Group` and `Label` parts to group items in a section.

```jsx line=6-7,11
<Select.Root>
	<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
	<Select.Portal>
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Viewport>
				<Select.Group>
					<Select.Label>Label</Select.Label>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				</Select.Group>
			</Select.Viewport>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Portal>
</Select.Root>
```

### With complex items

You can use custom content in your items.

```jsx line=11
import { Select } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item>
						<Select.ItemText>
							<img src="…" />
							Adolfo Hess
						</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				</Select.Viewport>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

### Controlling the value displayed in the trigger

By default the trigger will automatically display the selected item `ItemText`'s content. You can control what appears by chosing to put things inside/outside the `ItemText` part.

If you need more flexibility, you can control the component using `value`/`onValueChange` props and passing `children` to `SelectValue`. Remember to make sure what you put in there is accessible.

```jsx line=1,4,6
const countries = { france: "🇫🇷", "united-kingdom": "🇬🇧", spain: "🇪🇸" };

export default () => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("france");
	return (
		<Select.Root __value__={value} __onValueChange__={setValue}>
			<Select.Trigger>
				<Select.Value __aria-label__={value}>
					{__countries[value]__}
				</Select.Value>
				<Select.Icon />
			</Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item value="france">
						<Select.ItemText>France</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item value="united-kingdom">
						<Select.ItemText>United Kingdom</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item value="spain">
						<Select.ItemText>Spain</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
				</Select.Viewport>
			</Select.Content>
			</Select.Portal>
		</Select.Root>
	);
};
```

### With custom scrollbar

The native scrollbar is hidden by default as we recommend using the `ScrollUpButton` and `ScrollDownButton` parts for the best UX. If you do not want to use these parts, compose your select with our [Scroll Area](scroll-area) primitive.

```jsx line=10,12,18-20
// index.jsx
import { Select, ScrollArea } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<ScrollArea.Root __className__="ScrollAreaRoot" type="auto">
					<Select.Viewport __asChild__>
						<ScrollArea.Viewport __className__="ScrollAreaViewport">
							<StyledItem>…</StyledItem>
							<StyledItem>…</StyledItem>
							<StyledItem>…</StyledItem>
						</ScrollArea.Viewport>
					</Select.Viewport>
					<ScrollArea.Scrollbar
						__className__="ScrollAreaScrollbar"
						orientation="vertical"
					>
						<ScrollArea.Thumb __className__="ScrollAreaThumb" />
					</ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
				</ScrollArea.Root>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.ScrollAreaRoot {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}

.ScrollAreaViewport {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}

.ScrollAreaScrollbar {
	width: 4px;
	padding: 5px 2px;
}

.ScrollAreaThumb {
	background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
	border-radius: 3px;
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [ListBox WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox).

See the W3C [Select-Only Combobox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/combobox/combobox-select-only.html) example for more information.

### Keyboard Interactions

### Labelling

Use our [Label](label) component in order to offer a visual and accessible label for the select.

```jsx line=5,8,12
import { Select, Label } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<>
		<Label>
			Country
			<Select.Root>…</Select.Root>
		</Label>

		{/* or */}

		<Label htmlFor="country">Country</Label>
		<Select.Root>
			<Select.Trigger __id__="country">…</Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Portal>
				<Select.Content>…</Select.Content>
			</Select.Portal>
		</Select.Root>
	</>
);
```

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract down to `Select` and `SelectItem`

This example abstracts most of the parts.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Select, SelectItem } from "./your-select";

export default () => (
	<Select defaultValue="2">
		<SelectItem value="1">Item 1</SelectItem>
		<SelectItem value="2">Item 2</SelectItem>
		<SelectItem value="3">Item 3</SelectItem>
	</Select>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-select.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Select as SelectPrimitive } from "radix-ui";
import {
	CheckIcon,
	ChevronDownIcon,
	ChevronUpIcon,
} from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export const Select = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<SelectPrimitive.Root {...props}>
				<SelectPrimitive.Trigger ref={forwardedRef}>
					<SelectPrimitive.Value />
					<SelectPrimitive.Icon>
						<ChevronDownIcon />
					</SelectPrimitive.Icon>
				</SelectPrimitive.Trigger>
				<SelectPrimitive.Portal>
					<SelectPrimitive.Content>
						<SelectPrimitive.ScrollUpButton>
							<ChevronUpIcon />
						</SelectPrimitive.ScrollUpButton>
						<SelectPrimitive.Viewport>{children}</SelectPrimitive.Viewport>
						<SelectPrimitive.ScrollDownButton>
							<ChevronDownIcon />
						</SelectPrimitive.ScrollDownButton>
					</SelectPrimitive.Content>
				</SelectPrimitive.Portal>
			</SelectPrimitive.Root>
		);
	},
);

export const SelectItem = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<SelectPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				<SelectPrimitive.ItemText>{children}</SelectPrimitive.ItemText>
				<SelectPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
					<CheckIcon />
				</SelectPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
			</SelectPrimitive.Item>
		);
	},
);
```

# Slider

An input where the user selects a value from within a given range.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-slider
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a slider. It will render an `input` for each thumb when used within a `form` to ensure events propagate correctly.

### Track

The track that contains the `Slider.Range`.

### Range

The range part. Must live inside `Slider.Track`.

### Thumb

A draggable thumb. You can render multiple thumbs.

## Examples

### Vertical orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to create a vertical slider.

```jsx line=6
// index.jsx
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root
		className="SliderRoot"
		defaultValue={[50]}
		__orientation__="vertical"
	>
		<Slider.Track className="SliderTrack">
			<Slider.Range className="SliderRange" />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb className="SliderThumb" />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

```css line=7,18,26
/* styles.css */
.SliderRoot {
	position: relative;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
}
.SliderRoot[__data-orientation="vertical"__] {
	flex-direction: column;
	width: 20px;
	height: 100px;
}

.SliderTrack {
	position: relative;
	flex-grow: 1;
	background-color: grey;
}
.SliderTrack[__data-orientation="vertical"__] {
	width: 3px;
}

.SliderRange {
	position: absolute;
	background-color: black;
}
.SliderRange[__data-orientation="vertical"__] {
	width: 100%;
}

.SliderThumb {
	display: block;
	width: 20px;
	height: 20px;
	background-color: black;
}
```

### Create a range

Add multiple thumbs and values to create a range slider.

```jsx line=4,8-9
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root defaultValue={__[25, 75]__}>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

### Define step size

Use the `step` prop to increase the stepping interval.

```jsx line=4
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root defaultValue={[50]} __step__={10}>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

### Prevent thumb overlap

Use `minStepsBetweenThumbs` to avoid thumbs with equal values.

```jsx line=4
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root defaultValue={[25, 75]} step={10} __minStepsBetweenThumbs__={1}>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Slider WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb).

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract all parts

This example abstracts all of the `Slider` parts so it can be used as a self closing element.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Slider } from "./your-slider";

export default () => <Slider defaultValue={[25]} />;
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-slider.jsx
import { Slider as SliderPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Slider = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
	const value = props.value || props.defaultValue;

	return (
		<SliderPrimitive.Slider {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
			<SliderPrimitive.Track>
				<SliderPrimitive.Range />
			</SliderPrimitive.Track>
			{value.map((_, i) => (
				<SliderPrimitive.Thumb key={i} />
			))}
		</SliderPrimitive.Slider>
	);
});
```

## Caveats

### Mouse events are not fired

Because of [a limitation](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/blob/83a8c13bf66f3d9f17d77caeb187a69eb146930b/packages/react/slider/src/Slider.tsx#L383-L384) we faced during implementation, the following example won't work as expected and the `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` event handlers won't be fired:

```jsx
<Slider.Root
	onMouseDown={() => console.log("onMouseDown")}
	onMouseUp={() => console.log("onMouseUp")}
>
	…
</Slider.Root>
```

We recommend using pointer events instead (eg. `onPointerDown`, `onPointerUp`). Regardless of the above limitation, these events are better suited for cross-platform/device handling as they are fired for all pointer input types (mouse, touch, pen, etc.).

## Toast

A succinct message that is displayed temporarily.

# Toast

A succinct message that is displayed temporarily.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toast
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Toast } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Toast.Provider>
		<Toast.Root>
			<Toast.Title />
			<Toast.Description />
			<Toast.Action />
			<Toast.Close />
		</Toast.Root>

		<Toast.Viewport />
	</Toast.Provider>
);
```

## API Reference

### Provider

The provider that wraps your toasts and toast viewport. It usually wraps the application.

### Viewport

The fixed area where toasts appear. Users can jump to the viewport by pressing a hotkey. It is up to you to ensure the discoverability of the hotkey for keyboard users.

### Root

The toast that automatically closes. It should not be held open to [acquire a user response](/primitives/docs/components/toast#action).

### Title

An optional title for the toast.

### Description

The toast message.

### Action

An action that is safe to ignore to ensure users are not expected to complete tasks with unexpected side effects as a result of a [time limit](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html).

When obtaining a user response is necessary, portal an [`AlertDialog`](/primitives/docs/components/alert-dialog) styled as a toast into the viewport instead.

### Close

A button that allows users to dismiss the toast before its duration has elapsed.

## Examples

### Custom hotkey

Override the default hotkey using the `event.code` value for each key from [keycode.info](https://keycode.info/).

```jsx line=3
<Toast.Provider>
	{/* ... */}
	<Toast.Viewport __hotkey__={["altKey", "KeyT"]} />
</Toast.Provider>
```

### Custom duration

Customise the duration of a toast to override the provider value.

```jsx line=1
<Toast.Root __duration__={3000}>
	<Toast.Description>Saved!</Toast.Description>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Duplicate toasts

When a toast must appear every time a user clicks a button, use state to render multiple instances of the same toast (see below). Alternatively, you can abstract the parts to create your own [imperative API](/primitives/docs/components/toast#imperative-api).

```jsx line=6,11-15
export default () => {
	const [savedCount, setSavedCount] = React.useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<form onSubmit={() => setSavedCount((count) => count + 1)}>
				{/* ... */}
				<button>save</button>
			</form>

			{Array.from({ length: savedCount }).map((_, index) => (
				<Toast.Root key={index}>
					<Toast.Description>Saved!</Toast.Description>
				</Toast.Root>
			))}
		</div>
	);
};
```

### Animating swipe gesture

Combine `--radix-toast-swipe-move-[x|y]` and `--radix-toast-swipe-end-[x|y]` CSS variables with `data-swipe="[start|move|cancel|end]"` attributes to animate a swipe to close gesture. Here's an example:

```jsx line=6,7
// index.jsx
import { Toast } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Toast.Provider __swipeDirection__="right">
		<Toast.Root __className__="ToastRoot">...</Toast.Root>
		<Toast.Viewport />
	</Toast.Provider>
);
```

```css line=2,3,5,9,15
/* styles.css */
.ToastRoot[__data-swipe__="move"] {
	transform: translateX(var(__--radix-toast-swipe-move-x__));
}
.ToastRoot[__data-swipe__="cancel"] {
	transform: translateX(0);
	transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}
.ToastRoot[__data-swipe__="end"] {
	animation: slideRight 100ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideRight {
	from {
		transform: translateX(var(__--radix-toast-swipe-end-x__));
	}
	to {
		transform: translateX(100%);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [`aria-live` requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-live).

### Sensitivity

Control the sensitivity of the toast for screen readers using the `type` prop.

For toasts that are the result of a user action, choose `foreground`. Toasts generated from background tasks should use `background`.

#### Foreground

Foreground toasts are announced immediately. Assistive technologies may choose to clear previously queued messages when a foreground toast appears. Try to avoid stacking distinct foreground toasts at the same time.

#### Background

Background toasts are announced at the next graceful opportunity, for example, when the screen reader has finished reading its current sentence. They do not clear queued messages so overusing them can be perceived as a laggy user experience for screen reader users when used in response to a user interaction.

```jsx line=1,6
<Toast.Root type="foreground">
	<Toast.Description>File removed successfully.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>

<Toast.Root type="background">
	<Toast.Description>We've just released Radix 1.0.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Alternative action

Use the `altText` prop on the `Action` to instruct an alternative way of actioning the toast to screen reader users.

You can direct the user to a permanent place in your application where they can action it or implement your own custom hotkey logic. If implementing the latter, use `foreground` type to announce immediately and increase the duration to give the user ample time.

```jsx line=4,10,12
<Toast.Root type="background">
	<Toast.Title>Upgrade Available!</Toast.Title>
	<Toast.Description>We've just released Radix 1.0.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Action altText="Goto account settings to upgrade">
		Upgrade
	</Toast.Action>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>

<Toast.Root __type__="foreground" __duration__={10000}>
	<Toast.Description>File removed successfully.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Action altText="Undo (Alt+U)">
		Undo <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>
	</Toast.Action>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Close icon button

When providing an icon (or font icon), remember to label it correctly for screen reader users.

```jsx line=3-4
<Toast.Root type="foreground">
	<Toast.Description>Saved!</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Close aria-label="Close">
		<span aria-hidden>×</span>
	</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

### Abstract parts

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Toast } from "./your-toast";

export default () => (
	<Toast title="Upgrade available" content="We've just released Radix 3.0!">
		<button onClick={handleUpgrade}>Upgrade</button>
	</Toast>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-toast.jsx
import { Toast as ToastPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Toast = ({ title, content, children, ...props }) => {
	return (
		<ToastPrimitive.Root {...props}>
			{title && <ToastPrimitive.Title>{title}</ToastPrimitive.Title>}
			<ToastPrimitive.Description>{content}</ToastPrimitive.Description>
			{children && (
				<ToastPrimitive.Action asChild>{children}</ToastPrimitive.Action>
			)}
			<ToastPrimitive.Close aria-label="Close">
				<span aria-hidden>×</span>
			</ToastPrimitive.Close>
		</ToastPrimitive.Root>
	);
};
```

### Imperative API

Create your own imperative API to allow [toast duplication](/primitives/docs/components/toast#duplicate-toasts) if preferred.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Toast } from "./your-toast";

export default () => {
	const savedRef = React.useRef();
	return (
		<div>
			<form onSubmit={() => savedRef.current.publish()}>
				{/* ... */}
				<button>Save</button>
			</form>
			<Toast ref={savedRef}>Saved successfully!</Toast>
		</div>
	);
};
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-toast.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Toast as ToastPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Toast = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
	const { children, ...toastProps } = props;
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

	React.useImperativeHandle(forwardedRef, () => ({
		publish: () => setCount((count) => count + 1),
	}));

	return (
		<>
			{Array.from({ length: count }).map((_, index) => (
				<ToastPrimitive.Root key={index} {...toastProps}>
					<ToastPrimitive.Description>{children}</ToastPrimitive.Description>
					<ToastPrimitive.Close>Dismiss</ToastPrimitive.Close>
				</ToastPrimitive.Root>
			))}
		</>
	);
});
```

import { Toolbar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Toolbar.Root>
		<Toolbar.Button />
		<Toolbar.Separator />
		<Toolbar.Link />
		<Toolbar.ToggleGroup>
			<Toolbar.ToggleItem />
		</Toolbar.ToggleGroup>
	</Toolbar.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the toolbar component parts.

### Button

A button item.

### Link

A link item.

### ToggleGroup

A set of two-state buttons that can be toggled on or off.

### ToggleItem

An item in the group.

### Separator

Used to visually separate items in the toolbar.

## Examples

### Use with other primitives

All our primitives which expose a `Trigger` part, such as `Dialog`, `AlertDialog`, `Popover`, `DropdownMenu` can be composed within a toolbar by using the [`asChild` prop](/primitives/docs/guides/composition).

Here is an example using our `DropdownMenu` primitive.

```jsx line=8-10
import { Toolbar, DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Toolbar.Root>
		<Toolbar.Button>Action 1</Toolbar.Button>
		<Toolbar.Separator />
		<DropdownMenu.Root>
			<Toolbar.Button __asChild__>
				<DropdownMenu.Trigger>Trigger</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
			</Toolbar.Button>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>…</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Root>
	</Toolbar.Root>
);
```

## Accessibility

Uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/examples/radio/radio.html) to manage focus movement among items.

## Tooltip

A popup that displays information related to an element when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.

# Tooltip

A popup that displays information related to an element when the element
receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Provider>
		<Tooltip.Root>
			<Tooltip.Trigger />
			<Tooltip.Portal>
				<Tooltip.Content>
					<Tooltip.Arrow />
				</Tooltip.Content>
			</Tooltip.Portal>
		</Tooltip.Root>
	</Tooltip.Provider>
);
```

## API Reference

### Provider

Wraps your app to provide global functionality to your tooltips.

### Root

Contains all the parts of a tooltip.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the tooltip. By default, the `Tooltip.Content` will position itself against the trigger.

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the tooltip is open.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the tooltip. This can be used to help visually link the trigger with the `Tooltip.Content`. Must be rendered inside `Tooltip.Content`.

## Examples

### Configure globally

Use the `Provider` to control `delayDuration` and `skipDelayDuration` globally.

```jsx line=4
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Provider __delayDuration__={800} __skipDelayDuration__={500}>
		<Tooltip.Root>
			<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
			<Tooltip.Content>…</Tooltip.Content>
		</Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Root>
			<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
			<Tooltip.Content>…</Tooltip.Content>
		</Tooltip.Root>
	</Tooltip.Provider>
);
```

### Show instantly

Use the `delayDuration` prop to control the time it takes for the tooltip to open.

```jsx line=4
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root __delayDuration__={0}>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Content>…</Tooltip.Content>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-tooltip-trigger-width` and `--radix-tooltip-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Portal>
			<Tooltip.Content __className__="TooltipContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</Tooltip.Content>
		</Tooltip.Portal>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.TooltipContent {
	width: var(__--radix-tooltip-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-tooltip-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-tooltip-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Content __className__="TooltipContent">…</Tooltip.Content>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

```css line=3-4
/* styles.css */
.TooltipContent {
	transform-origin: var(--radix-tooltip-content-transform-origin);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Content __className__="TooltipContent">…</Tooltip.Content>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

```css line=6,9
/* styles.css */
.TooltipContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.TooltipContent[data-side="top"] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.TooltipContent[data-side="bottom"] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract parts and introduce a content prop

This example abstracts all of the `Tooltip` parts and introduces a new `content` prop.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "./your-tooltip";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip content="Tooltip content">
		<button>Tooltip trigger</button>
	</Tooltip>
);
```

#### Implementation

Use the [`asChild` prop](/primitives/docs/guides/composition) to convert the trigger part into a slottable area. It will replace the trigger with the child that gets passed to it.

```jsx line=8-10
// your-tooltip.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Tooltip as TooltipPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export function Tooltip({
	children,
	content,
	open,
	defaultOpen,
	onOpenChange,
	...props
}) {
	return (
		<TooltipPrimitive.Root
			open={open}
			defaultOpen={defaultOpen}
			onOpenChange={onOpenChange}
		>
			<TooltipPrimitive.Trigger __asChild__>
				{children}
			</TooltipPrimitive.Trigger>
			<TooltipPrimitive.Content side="top" align="center" {...props}>
				{content}
				<TooltipPrimitive.Arrow width={11} height={5} />
			</TooltipPrimitive.Content>
		</TooltipPrimitive.Root>
	);
}
```

# Utilities

## Accessible Icon

Makes icons accessible by adding a label.

# Accessible Icon

Makes icons accessible by adding a label.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-accessible-icon
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { AccessibleIcon } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <AccessibleIcon.Root />;
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains the icon to make accessible.

## Accessibility

Most icons or icon systems come with no accessibility built-in. For example, the same visual **cross** icon may in fact mean **"close"** or **"delete"**. This component lets you give meaning to icons used throughout your app.

This is built with [Visually Hidden](../utilities/visually-hidden).

## Direction Provider

Wraps your app to provide global reading direction.

# Direction Provider

Wraps your app to provide global reading direction.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-direction
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Direction } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <Direction.Provider />;
```

## API Reference

### Provider

When creating localized apps that require right-to-left (RTL) reading direction, you need to wrap your application with the `Direction.Provider` component to ensure all of the primitives adjust their behavior based on the `dir` prop.

## Example

Use the direction provider.

```jsx
import { Direction } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Direction.Provider dir="rtl">{/* your app */}</Direction.Provider>
);
```

---

## Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

# Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-portal
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Portal } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <Portal.Root />;
```

## Basic example

Use the portal primitive.

```jsx
import { Portal } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <Portal.Root>Content</Portal.Root>;
```

## API Reference

### Root

Anything you put inside this component will be rendered in a separate `<div>` element. By default, this element will be appended to `document.body` but you can choose a different container by using the `container` prop.

---

## Slot

Merges its props onto its immediate child.

# Slot

Merges its props onto its immediate child.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slot.Root>
		<div>Hello</div>
	</Slot.Root>
);
```

## Basic example

Use to create your own `asChild` API.

When your component has a single children element:

```jsx line=9
// your-button.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

function Button({ asChild, ...props }) {
	const Comp = asChild ? Slot.Root : "button";
	return <Comp {...props} />;
}
```

Use `Slottable` when your component has multiple children to pass the props to the correct element:

```jsx
// your-button.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

function Button({ asChild, children, leftElement, rightElement, ...props }) {
	const Comp = asChild ? Slot.Root : "button";
	return (
		<Comp {...props}>
			{leftElement}
			<Slot.Slottable>{children}</Slot.Slottable>
			{rightElement}
		</Comp>
	);
}
```

### Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from "./your-button";

export default () => (
	<Button asChild>
		<a href="/contact">Contact</a>
	</Button>
);
```

### Event handlers

Any prop that starts with `on` (e.g., `onClick`) is considered an event handler.

When merging event handlers, `Slot` will create a new function where the child handler takes precedence over the slot handler.

If one of the event handlers relies on `event.defaultPrevented` make sure that the order is correct.

```jsx
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slot.Root
		onClick={(event) => {
			if (!event.defaultPrevented)
				console.log("Not logged because default is prevented.");
		}}
	>
		<button onClick={(event) => event.preventDefault()} />
	</Slot.Root>
);
```

## Visually Hidden

Hides content from the screen in an accessible way.

# Visually Hidden

Hides content from the screen in an accessible way.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-visually-hidden
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <VisuallyHidden.Root />;
```

## Basic example

Use the visually hidden primitive.

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from "radix-ui";
import { GearIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export default () => (
	<button>
		<GearIcon />
		<VisuallyHidden.Root>Settings</VisuallyHidden.Root>
	</button>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Anything you put inside this component will be hidden from the screen but will be announced by screen readers.

## Accessibility

This is useful in certain scenarios as an alternative to traditional labelling with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
