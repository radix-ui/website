# Overview

## Accessibility

Radix Primitives follow the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and are tested in a wide selection of modern browsers and commonly used assistive technologies.

# Accessibility

Radix Primitives follow the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and are
tested in a wide selection of modern browsers and commonly used assistive
technologies.

We take care of many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including `aria` and `role` attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. That means that users should be able to use our components as-is in most contexts and rely on functionality to follow the expected accessibility design patterns.

## WAI-ARIA

[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/), published and maintained by the W3C, specifies the semantics for many common UI patterns that show up in Radix Primitives. This is designed to provide meaning for controls that aren't built using elements provided by the browser. For example, if you use a `div` instead of a `button` element to create a button, there are attributes you need to add to the `div` in order to convey that it's a button for screen readers or voice recognition tools.

In addition to semantics, there are behaviors that are expected from different types of components. A `button` element is going to respond to certain interactions in ways that a `div` will not, so it's up to the developer to reimplement those interactions with JavaScript. The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) provide additional guidance for implementing behaviors for various controls that come with Radix Primitives.

## Accessible Labels

With many built-in form controls, the native HTML `label` element is designed to provide semantic meaning and context for corresponding `input` elements. For non-form control elements, or for custom controls like those provided by Radix Primitives, [WAI-ARIA provides a specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#namecalculation) for how to provide accessible names and descriptions to those controls.

Where possible, Radix Primitives include abstractions to make labelling our controls simple. The [`Label`](../components/label) primitive is designed to work with many of our controls. Ultimately it's up to you to provide those labels so that users have the proper context when navigating your application.

## Keyboard Navigation

Many complex components, like [`Tabs`](../components/tabs) and [`Dialog`](../components/dialog), come with expectations from users on how to interact with their content using a keyboard or other non-mouse input modalities. Radix Primitives provide basic keyboard support in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).

## Focus Management

Proper keyboard navigation and good labelling often go hand-in-hand with managing focus. When a user interacts with an element and something changes as a result, it's often helpful to move focus with the interaction so that the next tab stop is logical depending on the new context of the app. And for screen reader users, moving focus often results in an announcement to convey this new context, which relies on proper labelling.

In many Radix Primitives, we move focus based on the interactions a user normally takes in a given component. For example, in [`AlertDialog`](../components/alert-dialog), when the modal is opened, focus is programmatically moved to a `Cancel` button element to anticipate a response to the prompt.

A quick tutorial to get you up and running with Radix Primitives.

## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install and style the [Popover](../components/popover) component.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install Radix Primitives from your command line.

```bash
npm install radix-ui@latest
```

### 2. Import the parts

Import and structure the parts.

```jsx line=3,6-14
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>More info</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>
				Some more info…
				<Popover.Arrow />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

### 3. Add your styles

Add styles where desired.

```jsx line=4,8,10,12
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger __className__="PopoverTrigger">Show info</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">
				Some content
				<Popover.Arrow __className__="PopoverArrow" />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.PopoverTrigger {
	background-color: white;
	border-radius: 4px;
}

.PopoverContent {
	border-radius: 4px;
	padding: 20px;
	width: 260px;
	background-color: white;
}

.PopoverArrow {
	fill: white;
}
```

### Demo

Here's a complete demo.

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.

## Introduction

An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.

# Introduction

An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible
design systems and web apps.

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.

## Vision

Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion, checkbox,
combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI patterns are [documented by WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) and generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate. They're
either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customized sufficiently.

So, developers are forced to build custom components; an incredibly difficult task. As a
result, most components on the web are inaccessible, non-performant, and lacking important
features.

Our goal is to create a well-funded, open-source component library that the community can
use to build accessible design systems.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) where possible. We handle many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. Learn more in our [accessibility](./accessibility) overview.

### Unstyled

Components ship without styles, giving you complete control over the look and feel. Components can be styled with any styling solution. Learn more in our [styling](../guides/styling) guide.

### Opened

Radix Primitives are designed to be customized to suit your needs. Our open component architecture provides you granular access to each component part, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, or refs.

### Uncontrolled

Where applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can also be controlled, alternatively. All of the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible, without needing to create any local states.

### Developer experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consistent and predictable experience. We've also implemented an `asChild` prop, giving users full control over the rendered element.

### Incremental adoption

We recommend installing the `radix-ui` package and importing the primitives you need. This is the simplest way to get started, prevent version conflicts or duplication, and makes it easy to manage updates. The package is tree-shakeable, so you should only ship the components you use.

```bash
npm install radix-ui
```

```tsx
import { Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
```

Alternatively, each primitive can be installed individually:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

```tsx
import * as Dialog from "@radix-ui/react-dialog";
import * as DropdownMenu from "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu";
import * as Tooltip from "@radix-ui/react-tooltip";
```

When installing separately, we recommend updating all Radix packages together to prevent duplication of shared dependencies and keep your bundle size down.

## Releases

Radix Primitives releases and their changelogs.

# Releases

Radix Primitives releases and their changelogs.

## May 5, 2025

This release introduces a brand new primitive in preview: [`PasswordToggleField`](../components/password-toggle-field).

This new primitive provides components for rendering a password input alongside a button to toggle its visibility. Aside from its primary functionality, it also includes:

- Returning focus to the input when toggling with a pointer
- Maintaining focus when toggling with keyboard or virtual navigation
- Resetting visibility to hidden after form submission to prevent accidental storage
- Implicit accessible labeling for icon-based toggle buttons

This API is currently unstable, and we hope you'll help us test it out! Import the primitive using the `unstable_` prefix.

```tsx
import { unstable_PasswordToggleField as PasswordToggleField } from "radix-ui";

export function PasswordField() {
	return (
		<PasswordToggleField.Root>
			<PasswordToggleField.Input />
			<PasswordToggleField.Toggle>
				<PasswordToggleField.Icon
					visible={<EyeOpenIcon />}
					hidden={<EyeClosedIcon />}
				/>
			</PasswordToggleField.Toggle>
		</PasswordToggleField.Root>
	);
}
```

### Other updates

- Add unstable `Provider`, `Trigger` and `BubbleInput` parts to Checkbox ([#3459](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/3459))
- Update default input type to `text` and pass to the underlying input element ([#3510](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/pull/3510))

## April 22, 2025

- Update the dependency for `use-sync-external-store` to ensure entrypoint is valid&#x20;

## April 17, 2025

This release introduces a brand new primitive in preview: [`OneTimePasswordField`](../components/one-time-password-field).

This new group of components are designed to implement a common design pattern for one-time password fields displayed as separate input fields for each character. This UI is deceptively complex to implement in such a way that interactions follow user expectations. The new primitive handles all of this complexity for you, including:

- Keyboard navigation mimicking the behavior of a single input field
- Overriding values on paste
- Password manager autofill support
- Input validation for numeric and alphanumeric values
- Auto-submit on completion
- Focus management
- Hidden input to provide a single value to form data

As this is a preview release, **the API is currently unstable**. We hope you'll help us test it out and let us know how it goes.

Import the primitive using the `unstable_` prefix.

```tsx
import { unstable_OneTimePasswordField as OneTimePasswordField } from "radix-ui";

export function Verify() {
	return (
		<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
			<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
		</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	);
}
```

### Other updates

- All form controls with internal bubble inputs now use the Radix `Primitive` component by default. This will allow us to expose these components in a future release so users can better control this behavior in the future.
- Minor improvements to `useControllableState` to enhance performance, reduce surface area for bugs, and log warnings when misused

## April 8, 2025

- Improved rendering performance for the Tooltip provider&#x20;
- Ensure Tooltip is closed when `pointerdown` is fired on the trigger&#x20;
- Add support for `crossOrigin` in Avatar images&#x20;
- Fix Avatar flashing when an image is already cached&#x20;
- Improve `displayName` for better debugging of slottable components&#x20;

## February 5, 2025

- Updated dependencies to remove peer dependency warnings for `react` and `react-dom`&#x20;
- Skip forwarding refs to `SlotClone` when the child is a `Fragment`&#x20;

## January 22, 2025

- Added a `radix-ui` package that exposes the latest version of all Radix Primitives from a single place. This tree-shakable entrypoint makes it easier to bring in whatever components you need and keep them up-to-date without worrying about conflicting or duplicate dependencies.
- Updated `aria-hidden` and `react-remove-scroll` dependencies for the following components:
  - Alert Dialog
  - Context Menu
  - Dialog
  - Dropdown Menu
  - Hover Card
  - Menubar
  - Navigation Menu
  - Popover
  - Select
  - Toast
  - Tooltip

# Guides

## Animation

Animate Radix Primitives with CSS keyframes or the JavaScript animation library of your choice.

# Animation

Animate Radix Primitives with CSS keyframes or the JavaScript animation
library of your choice.

Adding animation to Radix Primitives should feel similar to any other component, but there are some caveats noted here in regards to exiting animations with JS animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS animation

The simplest way to animate Primitives is with CSS.

You can use CSS animation to animate both mount and unmount phases. The latter is possible because the Radix Primitives will suspend unmount while your animation plays out.

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
	}
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
	from {
		opacity: 1;
	}
	to {
		opacity: 0;
	}
}

.DialogOverlay[data-state="open"],
.DialogContent[data-state="open"] {
	animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

.DialogOverlay[data-state="closed"],
.DialogContent[data-state="closed"] {
	animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in;
}
```

## Delegating unmounting for JavaScript Animation

When many stateful Primitives are hidden from view, they are actually removed from the React Tree, and their elements removed from the DOM. JavaScript animation libraries need control of the unmounting phase, so we provide the `forceMount` prop on many components to allow consumers to delegate the mounting and unmounting of children based on the animation state determined by those libraries.

For example, if you want to use React Spring to animate a `Dialog`, you would do so by conditionally rendering the dialog `Overlay` and `Content` parts based on the animation state from one of its hooks like `useTransition`:

```jsx
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";
import { useTransition, animated, config } from "react-spring";

function Example() {
	const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
	const transitions = useTransition(open, {
		from: { opacity: 0, y: -10 },
		enter: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
		leave: { opacity: 0, y: 10 },
		config: config.stiff,
	});
	return (
		<Dialog.Root open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
			<Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
			{transitions((styles, item) =>
				item ? (
					<>
						<Dialog.Overlay forceMount asChild>
							<animated.div
								style={{
									opacity: styles.opacity,
								}}
							/>
						</Dialog.Overlay>
						<Dialog.Content forceMount asChild>
							<animated.div style={styles}>
								<h1>Hello from inside the Dialog!</h1>
								<Dialog.Close>close</Dialog.Close>
							</animated.div>
						</Dialog.Content>
					</>
				) : null,
			)}
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
}
```

## Composition

Use the `asChild` prop to compose Radix's functionality onto alternative element types or your own React components.

# Composition

Use the `asChild` prop to compose Radix's functionality onto alternative
element types or your own React components.

All Radix primitive parts that render a DOM element accept an `asChild` prop. When `asChild` is set to `true`, Radix will not render a default DOM element, instead cloning the part's child and passing it the props and behavior required to make it functional.

## Changing the element type

In the majority of cases you shouldn’t need to modify the element type as Radix has been designed to provide the most appropriate defaults. However, there are cases where it is helpful to do so.

A good example is with `Tooltip.Trigger`. By default this part is rendered as a `button`, though you may want to add a tooltip to a link (`a` tag) as well. Let's see how you can achieve this using `asChild`:

```jsx line=7
import * as React from "react";
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger __asChild__>
			<a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/">Radix UI</a>
		</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Portal>…</Tooltip.Portal>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

> If you do decide to change the underlying element type, it is your responsibility to ensure it remains accessible and functional. In the case of `Tooltip.Trigger` for example, it must be a focusable element that can respond to pointer and keyboard events. If you were to switch it to a `div`, it would no longer be accessible.

In reality, you will rarely modify the underlying DOM element like we've seen above. Instead it's more common to use your own React components. This is especially true for most `Trigger` parts, as you usually want to compose the functionality with the custom buttons and links in your design system.

## Composing with your own React components

This works exactly the same as above, you pass `asChild` to the part and then wrap your own component with it.
However, there are a few gotchas to be aware of.

### Your component must spread props

When Radix clones your component, it will pass its own props and event handlers to make it functional and accessible. If your component doesn't support those props, it will break.

This is done by spreading all of the props onto the underlying DOM node.

```jsx line=5
// before
const MyButton = () => <button />;

// after
const MyButton = (props) => <button {...__props__} />;
```

We recommend always doing this so that you are not concerned with implementation details (ie. which props/events to accept). We find this is good practice for "leaf" components in general.

> Similarly to when changing the element type directly, it is your responsibility to ensure the element type rendered by your custom component remains accessible and functional.

### Your component must forward ref

Additionally, Radix will sometimes need to attach a `ref` to your component (for example to measure its size). If your component doesn't accept a `ref`, then it will break.

This is done using `React.forwardRef` (read more on [react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef)).

```jsx line=5-7
// before
const MyButton = (props) => <button {...props} />;

// after
const MyButton = __React.forwardRef__((props, __forwardedRef__) => (
	<button {...props} __ref__={__forwardedRef__} />
));
```

Whilst this isn't necessary for **all** parts, we recommend always doing it so that you are not concerned with implementation details. This is also generally good practice anyway for leaf components.

## Composing multiple primitives

`asChild` can be used as deeply as you need to. This means it is a great way to compose multiple primitive's behavior together.
Here is an example of how you can compose `Tooltip.Trigger` and `Dialog.Trigger` together with your own button:

```jsx line=12-16
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog, Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

const MyButton = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => (
	<button {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));

export default () => {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Tooltip.Root>
				<Tooltip.Trigger __asChild__>
					<Dialog.Trigger __asChild__>
						<MyButton>Open dialog</MyButton>
					</Dialog.Trigger>
				</Tooltip.Trigger>
				<Tooltip.Portal>…</Tooltip.Portal>
			</Tooltip.Root>

			<Dialog.Portal>...</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
};
```

## Server-side rendering

Radix Primitives can be rendered on the server. However, Primitives in React versions less than 18 rely on hydration for ids.

# Server-side rendering

Radix Primitives can be rendered on the server. However, Primitives in React
versions less than 18 rely on hydration for ids.

## Overview

Server-side rendering or `SSR`, is a technique used to render components to HTML on the server, as opposed to rendering them only on the client.

Static rendering is another similar approach. Instead it pre-renders pages to HTML at build time rather than on each request.

You should be able to use all of our primitives with both approaches, for example with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

## Gotcha

Primitives in React versions less than 18 rely on hydration for ids (used in aria attributes) to avoid server/client mismatch errors.

In other words, the equivalent of [Time to Interactive](https://web.dev/interactive/) for screen reader users will depend on the download speed of the JS bundle. If you'd like to generate ids server-side to improve this experience, we suggest upgrading to React 18.

## Styling

Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving you complete control over styling.

# Styling

Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving
you complete control over styling.

## Styling overview

### Functional styles

You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a [Dialog Overlay](../components/dialog) won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.

### Classes

All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/accordion) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.

## Styling with CSS

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targeting the `className` that you provide.

```jsx line=3,7
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const AccordionDemo = () => (
	<Accordion.Root>
		<Accordion.Item __className__="AccordionItem" value="item-1" />
		{/* … */}
	</Accordion.Root>
);

export default AccordionDemo;
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```css
.AccordionItem {
	border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.AccordionItem[__data-state__="open"] {
	border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

## Styling with CSS-in-JS

The examples below are using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), but you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.

### Styling a part

Most CSS-in-JS libraries export a function for passing components and their styles. You can provide the Radix primitive component directly.

```jsx line=5-7,11
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledItem = __styled__(Accordion.Item)`
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
`;

const AccordionDemo = () => (
	<Accordion.Root>
		<StyledItem value="item-1" />
		{/* … */}
	</Accordion.Root>
);

export default AccordionDemo;
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item)`
	border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;

	&[__data-state__="open"] {
		border-bottom-width: 2px;
	}
`;
```

## Extending a primitive

Extending a primitive is done the same way you extend any React component.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion as AccordionPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
	React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
	React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>((props, forwardedRef) => (
	<AccordionPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));
AccordionItem.displayName = "AccordionItem";
```

## Summary

Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.

For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.

# Components

## Accordion

A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content.

# Accordion

A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an
associated section of content.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-accordion
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Accordion.Root>
		<Accordion.Item>
			<Accordion.Header>
				<Accordion.Trigger />
			</Accordion.Header>
			<Accordion.Content />
		</Accordion.Item>
	</Accordion.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of an accordion.

### Item

Contains all the parts of a collapsible section.

### Header

Wraps an `Accordion.Trigger`. Use the `asChild` prop to update it to the appropriate heading level for your page.

### Trigger

Toggles the collapsed state of its associated item. It should be nested inside of an `Accordion.Header`.

### Content

Contains the collapsible content for an item.

## Examples

### Expanded by default

Use the `defaultValue` prop to define the open item by default.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root type="single" __defaultValue__="item-2">
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Allow collapsing all items

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow all items to close.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root type="single" __collapsible__>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Multiple items open at the same time

Set the `type` prop to `multiple` to enable opening multiple items at once.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root type="__multiple__">
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Rotated icon when open

You can add extra decorative elements, such as chevrons, and rotate it when the item is open.

```jsx line=12
// index.jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import { ChevronDownIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Accordion.Root type="single">
		<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
			<Accordion.Header>
				<Accordion.Trigger className="AccordionTrigger">
					<span>Trigger text</span>
					<ChevronDownIcon __className__="AccordionChevron" aria-hidden />
				</Accordion.Trigger>
			</Accordion.Header>
			<Accordion.Content>…</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Item>
	</Accordion.Root>
);
```

```css line=5-7
/* styles.css */
.AccordionChevron {
	transition: transform 300ms;
}
.AccordionTrigger[data-state="open"] > .AccordionChevron {
	transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

### Horizontal orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to create a horizontal accordion.

```jsx line=1
<Accordion.Root __orientation__="horizontal">
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">…</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">…</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Animating content size

Use the `--radix-accordion-content-width` and/or `--radix-accordion-content-height` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it opens/closes:

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Accordion.Root type="single">
		<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
			<Accordion.Header>…</Accordion.Header>
			<Accordion.Content __className__="AccordionContent">…</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Item>
	</Accordion.Root>
);
```

```css line=21,27
/* styles.css */
.AccordionContent {
	overflow: hidden;
}
.AccordionContent[data-state="open"] {
	animation: slideDown 300ms ease-out;
}
.AccordionContent[data-state="closed"] {
	animation: slideUp 300ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		height: 0;
	}
	to {
		height: var(__--radix-accordion-content-height__);
	}
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		height: var(__--radix-accordion-content-height__);
	}
	to {
		height: 0;
	}
}
```

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-avatar
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Avatar } from "radix-ui";

);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of an avatar.

### Image

The image to render. By default it will only render when it has loaded. You can use the `onLoadingStatusChange` handler if you need more control.

### Fallback

An element that renders when the image hasn't loaded. This means whilst it's loading, or if there was an error. If you notice a flash during loading, you can provide a `delayMs` prop to delay its rendering so it only renders for those with slower connections. For more control, use the `onLoadingStatusChange` handler on `Avatar.Image`.

## Examples

### Clickable Avatar with tooltip

You can compose the Avatar with a [Tooltip](/primitives/docs/components/tooltip) to display extra information.

```jsx line=1,4,5,7,9-13
import { Avatar, __Tooltip__ } from "radix-ui";

```jsx line=5,9-14,16
import { DividerHorizontalIcon, CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Checkbox } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState("indeterminate");

## Examples

### With submenus

You can create submenus by using `ContextMenu.Sub` in combination with its parts.

```jsx line=8-17
<ContextMenu.Root>
	<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
	<ContextMenu.Portal>
		<ContextMenu.Content>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>

				</ContextMenu.Portal>
			</ContextMenu.Sub>
			<ContextMenu.Separator />
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
		</ContextMenu.Content>
	</ContextMenu.Portal>
</ContextMenu.Root>
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content>
				<ContextMenu.Item __className__="ContextMenuItem" __disabled__>
					…
				</ContextMenu.Item>
				<ContextMenu.Item className="ContextMenuItem">…</ContextMenu.Item>
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: gainsboro;
}
```

### With separators

```jsx line=6,8
<ContextMenu.Root>
	<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
	<ContextMenu.Portal>
		<ContextMenu.Content>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Separator />
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Separator />
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
		</ContextMenu.Content>
	</ContextMenu.Portal>
</ContextMenu.Root>
```

### With labels

Use the `Label` part to help label a section.

```jsx line=5
<ContextMenu.Root>
	<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
	<ContextMenu.Portal>
		<ContextMenu.Content>
			<ContextMenu.Label>Label</ContextMenu.Label>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
			<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
		</ContextMenu.Content>
	</ContextMenu.Portal>
</ContextMenu.Root>
```

### With checkbox items

Use the `CheckboxItem` part to add an item that can be checked.

```jsx line=6,16-21
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

	return (
		<ContextMenu.Root>
			<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
			<ContextMenu.Portal>
				<ContextMenu.Content>
					<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
					<ContextMenu.Item>…</ContextMenu.Item>
					<ContextMenu.Separator />
					<ContextMenu.CheckboxItem
						checked={checked}
						onCheckedChange={setChecked}
					>
						<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							<CheckIcon />
						</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
						Checkbox item
					</ContextMenu.CheckboxItem>
				</ContextMenu.Content>
			</ContextMenu.Portal>
		</ContextMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With radio items

Use the `RadioGroup` and `RadioItem` parts to add an item that can be checked amongst others.

```jsx line=6,13-32
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [color, setColor] = React.useState("blue");

	return (
		<ContextMenu.Root>
			<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
			<ContextMenu.Portal>
				<ContextMenu.Content>
					<ContextMenu.RadioGroup value={color} onValueChange={setColor}>
						<ContextMenu.RadioItem value="red">
							<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Red
						</ContextMenu.RadioItem>
						<ContextMenu.RadioItem value="blue">
							<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Blue
						</ContextMenu.RadioItem>
						<ContextMenu.RadioItem value="green">
							<ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</ContextMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Green
						</ContextMenu.RadioItem>
					</ContextMenu.RadioGroup>
				</ContextMenu.Content>
			</ContextMenu.Portal>
		</ContextMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With complex items

You can add extra decorative elements in the `Item` parts, such as images.

```jsx line=9,13
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content>
				<ContextMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Adolfo Hess
				</ContextMenu.Item>
				<ContextMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Miyah Myles
				</ContextMenu.Item>
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content/sub-content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content (or sub-content) so that it matches the trigger (or sub-trigger) width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-context-menu-trigger-width` and `--radix-context-menu-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content __className__="ContextMenuContent">
				…
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuContent {
	width: var(__--radix-context-menu-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-context-menu-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-context-menu-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content __className__="ContextMenuContent">
				…
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-context-menu-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<ContextMenu.Root>
		<ContextMenu.Trigger>…</ContextMenu.Trigger>
		<ContextMenu.Portal>
			<ContextMenu.Content __className__="ContextMenuContent">
				…
			</ContextMenu.Content>
		</ContextMenu.Portal>
	</ContextMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.ContextMenuContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.ContextMenuContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.ContextMenuContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window,
rendering the content underneath inert.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Dialog.Root>
		<Dialog.Trigger />
		<Dialog.Portal>
			<Dialog.Overlay />
			<Dialog.Content>
				<Dialog.Title />
				<Dialog.Description />
				<Dialog.Close />
			</Dialog.Content>
		</Dialog.Portal>
	</Dialog.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a dialog.

### Trigger

The button that opens the dialog.

### Portal

When used, portals your overlay and content parts into the `body`.

### Overlay

A layer that covers the inert portion of the view when the dialog is open.

### Content

Contains content to be rendered in the open dialog.

### Close

The button that closes the dialog.

### Title

An accessible title to be announced when the dialog is opened.

If you want to hide the title, wrap it inside our [Visually Hidden](../utilities/visually-hidden) utility like this `<VisuallyHidden asChild>`.

### Description

An optional accessible description to be announced when the dialog is opened.

If you want to hide the description, wrap it inside our [Visually Hidden](../utilities/visually-hidden) utility like this `<VisuallyHidden asChild>`. If you want to remove the description entirely, remove this part and pass `aria-describedby={undefined}` to `Dialog.Content`.

## Examples

### Close after asynchronous form submission

Use the controlled props to programmatically close the Dialog after an async operation has completed.

```jsx line=4,7,10,15,17
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";

const wait = () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

export default () => {
	const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

	return (
		<Dialog.Root __open__={open} __onOpenChange__={setOpen}>
			<Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Dialog.Overlay />
				<Dialog.Content>
					<form
						onSubmit={(event) => {
							wait().then(() => setOpen(false));
							event.preventDefault();
						}}
					>
						{/** some inputs */}
						<button type="submit">Submit</button>
					</form>
				</Dialog.Content>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
};
```

### Scrollable overlay

Move the content inside the overlay to render a dialog with overflow.

```jsx
// index.jsx
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Dialog.Trigger />
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Dialog.Overlay className="DialogOverlay">
					<Dialog.Content className="DialogContent">...</Dialog.Content>
				</Dialog.Overlay>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
};
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.DialogOverlay {
	background: rgba(0 0 0 / 0.5);
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	display: grid;
	place-items: center;
	overflow-y: auto;
}

.DialogContent {
	min-width: 300px;
	background: white;
	padding: 30px;
	border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Custom portal container

Customise the element that your dialog portals into.

```jsx line=5,10,16
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [container, setContainer] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<div>
			<Dialog.Root>
				<Dialog.Trigger />
				<Dialog.Portal __container__={container}>
					<Dialog.Overlay />
					<Dialog.Content>...</Dialog.Content>
				</Dialog.Portal>
			</Dialog.Root>

			<div ref={__setContainer__} />
		</div>
	);
};
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Dialog WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal).

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract the overlay and the close button

This example abstracts the `Dialog.Overlay` and `Dialog.Close` parts.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Dialog, DialogTrigger, DialogContent } from "./your-dialog";

export default () => (
	<Dialog>
		<DialogTrigger>Dialog trigger</DialogTrigger>
		<DialogContent>Dialog Content</DialogContent>
	</Dialog>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-dialog.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Dialog as DialogPrimitive } from "radix-ui";
import { Cross1Icon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export const DialogContent = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => (
		<DialogPrimitive.Portal>
			<DialogPrimitive.Overlay />
			<DialogPrimitive.Content {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<DialogPrimitive.Close aria-label="Close">
					<Cross1Icon />
				</DialogPrimitive.Close>
			</DialogPrimitive.Content>
		</DialogPrimitive.Portal>
	),
);

export const Dialog = DialogPrimitive.Root;
export const DialogTrigger = DialogPrimitive.Trigger;
```

## Examples

### With submenus

You can create submenus by using `DropdownMenu.Sub` in combination with its parts.

```jsx line=8-17
<DropdownMenu.Root>
	<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
	<DropdownMenu.Portal>
		<DropdownMenu.Content>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>

						<DropdownMenu.Item>Sub menu item</DropdownMenu.Item>
						<DropdownMenu.Arrow />
					</DropdownMenu.SubContent>
				</DropdownMenu.Portal>
			</DropdownMenu.Sub>
			<DropdownMenu.Separator />
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
		</DropdownMenu.Content>
	</DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>
				<DropdownMenu.Item __className__="DropdownMenuItem" __disabled__>
					…
				</DropdownMenu.Item>
				<DropdownMenu.Item className="DropdownMenuItem">…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: gainsboro;
}
```

### With separators

Use the `Separator` part to add a separator between items.

```jsx line=6,8
<DropdownMenu.Root>
	<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
	<DropdownMenu.Portal>
		<DropdownMenu.Content>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Separator />
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Separator />
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
		</DropdownMenu.Content>
	</DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

### With labels

Use the `Label` part to help label a section.

```jsx line=5
<DropdownMenu.Root>
	<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
	<DropdownMenu.Portal>
		<DropdownMenu.Content>
			<DropdownMenu.Label>Label</DropdownMenu.Label>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
			<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
		</DropdownMenu.Content>
	</DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

### With checkbox items

Use the `CheckboxItem` part to add an item that can be checked.

```jsx line=6,16-21
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

	return (
		<DropdownMenu.Root>
			<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
			<DropdownMenu.Portal>
				<DropdownMenu.Content>
					<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
					<DropdownMenu.Item>…</DropdownMenu.Item>
					<DropdownMenu.Separator />
					<DropdownMenu.CheckboxItem
						checked={checked}
						onCheckedChange={setChecked}
					>
						<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							<CheckIcon />
						</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
						Checkbox item
					</DropdownMenu.CheckboxItem>
				</DropdownMenu.Content>
			</DropdownMenu.Portal>
		</DropdownMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With radio items

Use the `RadioGroup` and `RadioItem` parts to add an item that can be checked amongst others.

```jsx line=6,13-32
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [color, setColor] = React.useState("blue");

	return (
		<DropdownMenu.Root>
			<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
			<DropdownMenu.Portal>
				<DropdownMenu.Content>
					<DropdownMenu.RadioGroup value={color} onValueChange={setColor}>
						<DropdownMenu.RadioItem value="red">
							<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Red
						</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
						<DropdownMenu.RadioItem value="blue">
							<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Blue
						</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
						<DropdownMenu.RadioItem value="green">
							<DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator>
							Green
						</DropdownMenu.RadioItem>
					</DropdownMenu.RadioGroup>
				</DropdownMenu.Content>
			</DropdownMenu.Portal>
		</DropdownMenu.Root>
	);
};
```

### With complex items

You can add extra decorative elements in the `Item` parts, such as images.

```jsx line=9,13
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>
				<DropdownMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Adolfo Hess
				</DropdownMenu.Item>
				<DropdownMenu.Item>
					<img src="…" />
					Miyah Myles
				</DropdownMenu.Item>
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content/sub-content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content (or sub-content) so that it matches the trigger (or sub-trigger) width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-dropdown-menu-trigger-width` and `--radix-dropdown-menu-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content __className__="DropdownMenuContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuContent {
	width: var(__--radix-dropdown-menu-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-dropdown-menu-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-dropdown-menu-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content __className__="DropdownMenuContent">
				…
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-dropdown-menu-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu.Root>
		<DropdownMenu.Trigger>…</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
		<DropdownMenu.Portal>
			<DropdownMenu.Content __className__="DropdownMenuContent">
				…
			</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Portal>
	</DropdownMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.DropdownMenuContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.DropdownMenuContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.DropdownMenuContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Menu Button WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu-button/) and uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex) to manage focus movement among menu items.

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract the arrow and item indicators

This example abstracts the `DropdownMenu.Arrow` and `DropdownMenu.ItemIndicator` parts. It also wraps implementation details for `CheckboxItem` and `RadioItem`.

#### Usage

```jsx
import {
	DropdownMenu,
	DropdownMenuTrigger,
	DropdownMenuContent,
	DropdownMenuLabel,
	DropdownMenuItem,
	DropdownMenuGroup,
	DropdownMenuCheckboxItem,
	DropdownMenuRadioGroup,
	DropdownMenuRadioItem,
	DropdownMenuSeparator,
} from "./your-dropdown-menu";

export default () => (
	<DropdownMenu>
		<DropdownMenuTrigger>DropdownMenu trigger</DropdownMenuTrigger>
		<DropdownMenuContent>
			<DropdownMenuItem>Item</DropdownMenuItem>
			<DropdownMenuLabel>Label</DropdownMenuLabel>
			<DropdownMenuGroup>Group</DropdownMenuGroup>
			<DropdownMenuCheckboxItem>CheckboxItem</DropdownMenuCheckboxItem>
			<DropdownMenuSeparator>Separator</DropdownMenuSeparator>
			<DropdownMenuRadioGroup>
				<DropdownMenuRadioItem>RadioItem</DropdownMenuRadioItem>
				<DropdownMenuRadioItem>RadioItem</DropdownMenuRadioItem>
			</DropdownMenuRadioGroup>
		</DropdownMenuContent>
	</DropdownMenu>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-dropdown-menu.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { DropdownMenu as DropdownMenuPrimitive } from "radix-ui";
import { CheckIcon, DividerHorizontalIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export const DropdownMenu = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Root;
export const DropdownMenuTrigger = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Trigger;

export const DropdownMenuContent = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<DropdownMenuPrimitive.Portal>
				<DropdownMenuPrimitive.Content {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
					{children}
					<DropdownMenuPrimitive.Arrow />
				</DropdownMenuPrimitive.Content>
			</DropdownMenuPrimitive.Portal>
		);
	},
);

export const DropdownMenuLabel = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Label;
export const DropdownMenuItem = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Item;
export const DropdownMenuGroup = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Group;

export const DropdownMenuCheckboxItem = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<DropdownMenuPrimitive.CheckboxItem {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
					{props.checked === "indeterminate" && <DividerHorizontalIcon />}
					{props.checked === true && <CheckIcon />}
				</DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
			</DropdownMenuPrimitive.CheckboxItem>
		);
	},
);

export const DropdownMenuRadioGroup = DropdownMenuPrimitive.RadioGroup;

export const DropdownMenuRadioItem = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<DropdownMenuPrimitive.RadioItem {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
					<CheckIcon />
				</DropdownMenuPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
			</DropdownMenuPrimitive.RadioItem>
		);
	},
);

export const DropdownMenuSeparator = DropdownMenuPrimitive.Separator;
```

## Form

Collect information from your users using validation rules.

# Form

Collect information from your users using validation rules.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-form
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Form } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Form.Root>
		<Form.Field>
			<Form.Label />
			<Form.Control />
			<Form.Message />
			<Form.ValidityState />
		</Form.Field>

		<Form.Message />
		<Form.ValidityState />

		<Form.Submit />
	</Form.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a form.

### Field

The wrapper for a field. It handles id/name and label accessibility automatically.

### Label

A label element which is automatically wired when nested inside a `Field` part.

### Control

A control element (by default an `input`) which is automatically wired when nested inside a `Field` part.

### Message

A validation message which is automatically wired (functionality and accessibility) to a given control when nested inside a `Field` part. It can be used for built-in and custom client-side validation, as well as server-side validation. When used outside a `Field` you must pass a `name` prop matching a field.

`Form.Message` accepts a `match` prop which is used to determine when the message should show. It matches the native HTML validity state (`ValidityState` on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState)) which validates against attributes such as `required`, `min`, `max`. The message will show if the given `match` is `true` on the control’s validity state.

You can also pass a function to `match` to provide custom validation rules.

### ValidityState

Use this render-prop component to access a given field’s validity state in render (see `ValidityState` on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState)). A field's validity is available automatically when nested inside a `Field` part, otherwise you must pass a `name` prop to associate it.

### Submit

The submit button.

## Examples

### Composing with your own components

Using `asChild` you can compose the `Form` primitive parts with your own components.

```jsx line=3
<Form.Field name="name">
	<Form.Label>Full name</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control __asChild__>
		<TextField.Input variant="primary" />
	</Form.Control>
</Form.Field>
```

It can also be used to compose other types of controls, such as a `select`:

```jsx line=3
<Form.Field name="country">
	<Form.Label>Country</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control __asChild__>
		<select>
			<option value="uk">United Kingdom</option>…
		</select>
	</Form.Control>
</Form.Field>
```

> Note: At the moment, it is not possible to compose `Form` with Radix's other form primitives such as `Checkbox`, `Select`, etc. We are working on a solution for this.

### Providing your own validation messages

When no `children` are provided, `Form.Message` will render a default error message for the given `match`.

```jsx
// will yield "This value is missing"
<Form.Message match="valueMissing" />
```

You can provide a more meaningful message by passing your own `children`. This is also useful for internationalization.

```jsx
// will yield "Please provide a name"
<Form.Message match="valueMissing">__Please provide a name__</Form.Message>
```

### Custom validation

On top of all the built-in client-side validation matches described above you can also provide your own custom validation whilst still making use of the platform's validation abilities. It uses the `customError` type present in the [constraint validition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation).

You can pass your own validation function into the `match` prop on `Form.Message`. Here's an example:

```jsx line=4
<Form.Field name="name">
	<Form.Label>Full name</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control />
	<Form.Message __match__={(value, formData) => value !== "John"}>
		Only John is allowed.
	</Form.Message>
</Form.Field>
```

> `match` will be called with the current value of the control as first argument and the entire `FormData` as second argument.
> `match` can also be an `async` function (or return a promise) to perform async validation.

### Styling based on validity

We add `data-valid` and `data-invalid` attributes to the relevant parts. Use it to style your components accordingly.
Here is an example styling the `Label` part.

```jsx line=8
//index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Form } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Form.Root>
		<Form.Field name="email">
			<Form.Label __className__="FormLabel">Email</Form.Label>
			<Form.Control type="email" />
		</Form.Field>
	</Form.Root>
);
```

```css line=2,5
/* styles.css */
.FormLabel[__data-invalid__] {
	color: red;
}
.FormLabel[__data-valid__] {
	color: green;
}
```

### Accessing the validity state for more control

You may need to access the raw validity state of a field in order to display your own icons, or interface with a component library via it's defined props. You can do this by using the `Form.ValidityState` part:

```jsx line=3-4,7-8
<Form.Field name="name">
	<Form.Label>Full name</Form.Label>
	<Form.ValidityState>
		{(validity) => (
			<Form.Control asChild>
				<TextField.Input
					variant="primary"
					state={getTextFieldInputState(__validity__)}
				/>
			</Form.Control>
		)}
	</Form.ValidityState>
</Form.Field>
```

### Server-side validation

The component also supports server-side validation using the same `Form.Message` component.
You can re-use the same messages you defined for client-side errors by passing a `forceMatch` prop which will force the message to show regardless of the client-side matching logic.

If the message doesn't exist on the client-side, you can render a `Form.Message` without a `match` too.
The field is marked as invalid by passing a `serverInvalid` boolean prop to the `Form.Field` part.

Here's an example with server-side error handling:

```jsx line=5-8,13,23,28-30,49-54
import * as React from "react";
import { Form } from "radix-ui";

function Page() {
	const [serverErrors, setServerErrors] = React.useState({
		email: false,
		password: false,
	});

	return (
		<Form.Root
			// `onSubmit` only triggered if it passes client-side validation
			onSubmit={(event) => {
				const data = Object.fromEntries(new FormData(event.currentTarget));

				// Submit form data and catch errors in the response
				submitForm(data)
					.then(() => {})
					/**
					 * Map errors from your server response into a structure you'd like to work with.
					 * In this case resulting in this object: `{ email: false, password: true }`
					 */
					.catch((errors) => __setServerErrors__(mapServerErrors(errors)));

				// prevent default form submission
				event.preventDefault();
			}}
			onClearServerErrors={() =>
				__setServerErrors__({ email: false, password: false })
			}
		>
			<Form.Field name="email" __serverInvalid__={serverErrors.email}>
				<Form.Label>Email address</Form.Label>
				<Form.Control type="email" required />
				<Form.Message match="valueMissing">
					Please enter your email.
				</Form.Message>
				<Form.Message match="typeMismatch" __forceMatch__={serverErrors.email}>
					Please provide a valid email.
				</Form.Message>
			</Form.Field>

			<Form.Field name="password" __serverInvalid__={serverErrors.password}>
				<Form.Label>Password</Form.Label>
				<Form.Control type="password" required />
				<Form.Message match="valueMissing">
					Please enter a password.
				</Form.Message>
				{serverErrors.password && (
					<Form.Message>
						Please provide a valid password. It should contain at least 1 number
						and 1 special character.
					</Form.Message>
				)}
			</Form.Field>

			<Form.Submit>Submit</Form.Submit>
		</Form.Root>
	);
}
```

You should clear the server errors using the `onClearServerErrors` callback prop on the `Form.Root` part. It will clear the server errors before the form is re-submitted, and when the form is reset.

In addition, this provides control over when to reset single server errors. For example you could reset the email server error as soon as the user edits it:

```jsx line=3
<Form.Field name="email" serverInvalid={serverErrors.email}>
	<Form.Label>Email address</Form.Label>
	<Form.Control
		type="email"
		__onChange__={() => setServerErrors((prev) => ({ ...prev, email: false }))}
	/>
	<Form.Message match="valueMissing">Please enter your email.</Form.Message>
	<Form.Message match="typeMismatch" forceMatch={serverErrors.email}>
		Please provide a valid email.
	</Form.Message>
</Form.Field>
```

## Accessibility

The component follows the "inline errors" pattern for validation:

- Label and control are associated using the `name` provided on `Form.Field`
- When one or more client-side error messages display, they are automatically associated with their matching control and announced accordingly
- Focus is moved to the first invalid control

## Hover Card

For sighted users to preview content available behind a link.

# Hover Card

For sighted users to preview content available behind a link.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-hover-card
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger />
		<HoverCard.Portal>
			<HoverCard.Content>
				<HoverCard.Arrow />
			</HoverCard.Content>
		</HoverCard.Portal>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a hover card.

### Trigger

The link that opens the hover card when hovered.

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the hover card is open.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the hover card. This can be used to help visually link the trigger with the `HoverCard.Content`. Must be rendered inside `HoverCard.Content`.

## Examples

### Show instantly

Use the `openDelay` prop to control the time it takes for the hover card to open.

```jsx line=4
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root __openDelay__={0}>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Content>…</HoverCard.Content>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-hover-card-trigger-width` and `--radix-hover-card-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Portal>
			<HoverCard.Content __className__="HoverCardContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</HoverCard.Content>
		</HoverCard.Portal>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.HoverCardContent {
	width: var(__--radix-hover-card-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-hover-card-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-hover-card-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Content __className__="HoverCardContent">…</HoverCard.Content>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.HoverCardContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-hover-card-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { HoverCard } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<HoverCard.Root>
		<HoverCard.Trigger>…</HoverCard.Trigger>
		<HoverCard.Content __className__="HoverCardContent">…</HoverCard.Content>
	</HoverCard.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.HoverCardContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.HoverCardContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.HoverCardContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

The hover card is intended for sighted users only, the content will be inaccessible to keyboard users.

			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Menu>
</Menubar.Root>
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=11
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content>
					<Menubar.Item __className__="MenubarItem" __disabled__>

	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.MenubarItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: gainsboro;
}
```

### With separators

```jsx line=7,9
<Menubar.Root>
	<Menubar.Menu>
		<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
		<Menubar.Portal>
			<Menubar.Content>
				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
				<Menubar.Separator />
				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>

				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Menu>
</Menubar.Root>
```

### With labels

Use the `Label` part to help label a section.

```jsx line=6
<Menubar.Root>

				<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Menu>
</Menubar.Root>
```

### With checkbox items

Use the `CheckboxItem` part to add an item that can be checked.

```jsx line=6,17-22
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

	return (
		<Menubar.Root>
			<Menubar.Menu>
				<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
				<Menubar.Portal>
					<Menubar.Content>
						<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
						<Menubar.Item>…</Menubar.Item>
						<Menubar.Separator />
						<Menubar.CheckboxItem
							checked={checked}
							onCheckedChange={setChecked}
						>
							<Menubar.ItemIndicator>
								<CheckIcon />
							</Menubar.ItemIndicator>
							Checkbox item
						</Menubar.CheckboxItem>
					</Menubar.Content>
				</Menubar.Portal>
			</Menubar.Menu>
		</Menubar.Root>
	);
};
```

### With radio items

Use the `RadioGroup` and `RadioItem` parts to add an item that can be checked amongst others.

```jsx line=6,14-27
import * as React from "react";
import { CheckIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => {
	const [color, setColor] = React.useState("blue");

	return (
		<Menubar.Root>
			<Menubar.Menu>
				<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
				<Menubar.Portal>
					<Menubar.Content>
						<Menubar.RadioGroup value={color} onValueChange={setColor}>

								<Menubar.ItemIndicator>
									<CheckIcon />
								</Menubar.ItemIndicator>
								Red
							</Menubar.RadioItem>
							<Menubar.RadioItem value="blue">
								<Menubar.ItemIndicator>
									<CheckIcon />
								</Menubar.ItemIndicator>
								Blue
							</Menubar.RadioItem>
						</Menubar.RadioGroup>
					</Menubar.Content>
				</Menubar.Portal>
			</Menubar.Menu>
		</Menubar.Root>
	);
};
```

### With complex items

You can add extra decorative elements in the `Item` parts, such as images.

```jsx line=10,14
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content>
					<Menubar.Item>
						<img src="…" />
						Adolfo Hess
					</Menubar.Item>
					<Menubar.Item>
						<img src="…" />
						Miyah Myles
					</Menubar.Item>
				</Menubar.Content>
			</Menubar.Portal>
		</Menubar.Menu>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content/sub-content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content (or sub-content) so that it matches the trigger (or sub-trigger) width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-menubar-trigger-width` and `--radix-menubar-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
		<Menubar.Portal>
			<Menubar.Content __className__="MenubarContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</Menubar.Content>
		</Menubar.Portal>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.MenubarContent {
	width: var(__--radix-menubar-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-menubar-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-menubar-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content __className__="MenubarContent">…</Menubar.Content>
			</Menubar.Portal>
		</Menubar.Menu>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.MenubarContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-menubar-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=10
// index.jsx
import { Menubar } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Menubar.Root>
		<Menubar.Menu>
			<Menubar.Trigger>…</Menubar.Trigger>
			<Menubar.Portal>
				<Menubar.Content __className__="MenubarContent">…</Menubar.Content>
			</Menubar.Portal>
		</Menubar.Menu>
	</Menubar.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.MenubarContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.MenubarContent[__data-side="top"__] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.MenubarContent[__data-side="bottom"__] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Menu Button WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu-button/) and uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex) to manage focus movement among menu items.

# Navigation Menu

A collection of links for navigating websites.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-navigation-menu
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger />
				<NavigationMenu.Content>
					<NavigationMenu.Link />
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Link />
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

				<NavigationMenu.Content>
					<NavigationMenu.Sub>
						<NavigationMenu.List />
						<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
					</NavigationMenu.Sub>
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Indicator />
		</NavigationMenu.List>

		<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a navigation menu.

### Sub

Signifies a submenu. Use it in place of the root part when nested to create a submenu.

### List

Contains the top level menu items.

### Item

A top level menu item, contains a link or trigger with content combination.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the content.

### Content

Contains the content associated with each trigger.

### Link

A navigational link.

### Indicator

An optional indicator element that renders below the list, is used to highlight the currently active trigger.

### Viewport

An optional viewport element that is used to render active content outside of the list.

## Examples

### Vertical

You can create a vertical menu by using the `orientation` prop.

```jsx line=1
<NavigationMenu.Root __orientation__="vertical">
	<NavigationMenu.List>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item Two content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
	</NavigationMenu.List>
</NavigationMenu.Root>
```

### Flexible layouts

Use the `Viewport` part when you need extra control over where `Content` is rendered. This can be helpful when your design
requires an adjusted DOM structure or if you need flexibility to achieve [advanced animation](/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu#advanced-animation).
Tab focus will be maintained automatically.

```jsx line=14
<NavigationMenu.Root>
	<NavigationMenu.List>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item two content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
	</NavigationMenu.List>

	{/* NavigationMenu.Content will be rendered here when active */}
	<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
</NavigationMenu.Root>
```

### With indicator

You can use the optional `Indicator` part to highlight the currently active `Trigger`, this is useful when you want to provide
an animated visual cue such as an arrow or highlight to accompany the `Viewport`.

```jsx line=17
// index.jsx
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content>Item two content</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>

			<NavigationMenu.Indicator __className__="NavigationMenuIndicator" />
		</NavigationMenu.List>

		<NavigationMenu.Viewport />
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.NavigationMenuIndicator {
	background-color: grey;
}
.NavigationMenuIndicator[data-orientation="horizontal"] {
	height: 3px;
	transition:
		width,
		transform,
		250ms ease;
}
```

### With submenus

Create a submenu by nesting your `NavigationMenu` and using the `Sub` part in place of its `Root`.
Submenus work differently to `Root` navigation menus and are similar to [`Tabs`](/primitives/docs/components/tabs) in that one item should always be active, so be
sure to assign and set a `defaultValue`.

```jsx line=10,25
<NavigationMenu.Root>
	<NavigationMenu.List>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>Item one content</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
		<NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
			<NavigationMenu.Content>
				<NavigationMenu.__Sub__ __defaultValue__="sub1">
					<NavigationMenu.List>
						<NavigationMenu.Item value="sub1">
							<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Sub item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
							<NavigationMenu.Content>
								Sub item one content
							</NavigationMenu.Content>
						</NavigationMenu.Item>
						<NavigationMenu.Item value="sub2">
							<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Sub item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
							<NavigationMenu.Content>
								Sub item two content
							</NavigationMenu.Content>
						</NavigationMenu.Item>
					</NavigationMenu.List>
				</NavigationMenu.__Sub__>
			</NavigationMenu.Content>
		</NavigationMenu.Item>
	</NavigationMenu.List>
</NavigationMenu.Root>
```

### With client side routing

If you need to use the `Link` component provided by your routing package then we recommend composing with `NavigationMenu.Link` via a custom component.
This will ensure accessibility and consistent keyboard control is maintained. Here's an example using Next.js:

```jsx line=7-16,22,25
// index.jsx
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import NextLink from "next/link";
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const Link = ({ href, ...props }) => {
	const pathname = usePathname();
	const isActive = href === pathname;

	return (
		<NavigationMenu.Link asChild active={isActive}>
			<NextLink href={href} className="NavigationMenuLink" {...props} />
		</NavigationMenu.Link>
	);
};

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>

### Advanced animation

We expose `--radix-navigation-menu-viewport-[width|height]` and `data-motion['from-start'|'to-start'|'from-end'|'to-end']` attributes
to allow you to animate `Viewport` size and `Content` position based on the enter/exit direction.

Combining these with `position: absolute;` allows you to create smooth overlapping animation effects when moving between items.

```jsx line=10-12,16-18,22
// index.jsx
import { NavigationMenu } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<NavigationMenu.Root>
		<NavigationMenu.List>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item one</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content __className__="NavigationMenuContent">
					Item one content
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
			<NavigationMenu.Item>
				<NavigationMenu.Trigger>Item two</NavigationMenu.Trigger>
				<NavigationMenu.Content __className__="NavigationMenuContent">
					Item two content
				</NavigationMenu.Content>
			</NavigationMenu.Item>
		</NavigationMenu.List>

		<NavigationMenu.Viewport __className__="NavigationMenuViewport" />
	</NavigationMenu.Root>
);
```

```css line=9-20,24,25
/* styles.css */
.NavigationMenuContent {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	animation-duration: 250ms;
	animation-timing-function: ease;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="from-start"] {
	animation-name: enterFromLeft;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="from-end"] {
	animation-name: enterFromRight;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="to-start"] {
	animation-name: exitToLeft;
}
.NavigationMenuContent[__data-motion__="to-end"] {
	animation-name: exitToRight;
}

.NavigationMenuViewport {
	position: relative;
	width: var(__--radix-navigation-menu-viewport-width__);
	height: var(__--radix-navigation-menu-viewport-height__);
	transition:
		width,
		height,
		250ms ease;
}

@keyframes enterFromRight {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateX(200px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
}

@keyframes enterFromLeft {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateX(-200px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
}

@keyframes exitToRight {
	from {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);

@keyframes exitToLeft {
	from {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateX(-200px);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [`navigation` role requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#navigation).

### Differences to menubar

`NavigationMenu` should not be confused with `menubar`, although this primitive shares the name `menu` in the colloquial sense to refer to a set of navigation links, it does not use the WAI-ARIA `menu` role.
This is because `menu` and `menubars` behave like native operating system menus most commonly found in desktop application windows, as such they feature complex functionality like composite focus management and first-character navigation.

These features are often considered [unnecessary for website navigation](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/353) and at worst can confuse users who are familiar with established website patterns.

See the W3C [Disclosure Navigation Menu](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/disclosure/disclosure-navigation.html) example for more information.

### Link usage and aria-current

It's important to use `NavigationMenu.Link` for all navigational links within a menu, this not only applies to the main list
but also within any content rendered via `NavigationMenu.Content`. This will ensure consistent keyboard interactions and accessibility
while also giving access to the `active` prop for setting `aria-current` and the active styles.
See [this example](/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu#with-client-side-routing) for more information on usage with third party routing components.

## One-Time Password Field

A group of single-character text inputs to handle one-time password verification

# One-Time Password Field

A group of single-character text inputs to handle one-time password
verification.

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { unstable_OneTimePasswordField as OneTimePasswordField } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
		{/* one Input for each character of the value */}
		<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
		{/* single HiddenInput to store the full value */}
		<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
	</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a one-time password field.

### Input

Renders a text input representing a single character in the value.

### HiddenInput

## Examples

### Basic usage

```jsx
// This will render a field with 6 inputs, for use with
// 6-character passwords. Render an Input component for
// each character of accepted password's length.
<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
```

### Segmented controls

The `Root` component accepts arbitrary children, so rendering a visually segmented list is as simple as rendering separators between inputs. We recommend hiding decorative elements from assistive tech with `aria-hidden` and avoid rendering other meaningful content within `Root` since each child element is expected to belong to the parent with the `group` role.

```jsx line=3,5,7
<OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<Separator.Root aria-hidden />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<Separator.Root aria-hidden />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<Separator.Root aria-hidden />
	<OneTimePasswordField.Input />
	<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
```

### Auto-submit form when password is entered

Use the `autoSubmit` prop to submit an associated form when all inputs are filled.

```jsx
function Verify({ validCode }) {
	const PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6;
	function handleSubmit(event) {
		event.preventDefault();
		const formData = event.formData;
		if (formData.get("otp") === validCode) {
			redirect("/authenticated");
		} else {
			window.alert("Invalid code");
		}
	}
	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<OneTimePasswordField.Root name="otp" autoSubmit>
				{PASSWORD_LENGTH.map((_, i) => (
					<OneTimePasswordField.Input key={i} />
				))}
				{/* HiddenInput is required for the form to have data associated with the field */}
				<OneTimePasswordField.HiddenInput />
			</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
			<button>Submit</button>
		</form>
	);
}
```

### Controlled value

```jsx
function Verify({ validCode }) {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");
	const PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6;
	function handleSubmit() {
		if (value === validCode) {
			redirect("/authenticated");
		} else {
			window.alert("Invalid code");
		}
	}
	return (
		<OneTimePasswordField.Root
			autoSubmit
			value={value}
			onAutoSubmit={handleSubmit}
			onValueChange={setValue}
		>
			{PASSWORD_LENGTH.map((_, i) => (
				<OneTimePasswordField.Input key={i} />
			))}
		</OneTimePasswordField.Root>
	);
}
```

## Accessibility

At the time of writing, there is no singular established pattern in WCAG guidelines for implementing one-time password fields as separate inputs. The behavior aims to get as close as possible to having the field act as a single input, with a few exceptions to match user expectations based on our initial research, testing, and gathering feedback.

This component is implemented as `input` elements within a container with a role of `group` to indicate that child inputs are related. Inputs can be navigated and focused using direction keys, and typing input will move focus to the next input until the last input is reached.

Pasting a value into the field will replace the contents of all inputs, regardless of the currently focused input. Based on our research this seems to align with most user expectations, where values are often pasted from password-managers or an email.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger />
		<Popover.Anchor />
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>
				<Popover.Close />
				<Popover.Arrow />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a popover.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the popover. By default, the `Popover.Content` will position itself against the trigger.

### Anchor

An optional element to position the `Popover.Content` against. If this part is not used, the content will position alongside the .

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the popover is open.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the popover. This can be used to help visually link the anchor with the `Popover.Content`. Must be rendered inside `Popover.Content`.

### Close

The button that closes an open popover.

## Examples

### Constrain the content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-popover-trigger-width` and `--radix-popover-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>…</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.PopoverContent {
	width: var(__--radix-popover-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-popover-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-popover-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>…</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">…</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css line=3
/* styles.css */
.PopoverContent {
	transform-origin: var(__--radix-popover-content-transform-origin__);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>…</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">…</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css line=6-11
/* styles.css */
.PopoverContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.PopoverContent[__data-side__="top"] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.PopoverContent[__data-side__="bottom"] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

### With custom anchor

You can anchor the content to another element if you do not want to use the trigger as the anchor.

```jsx line=7-11
// index.jsx
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Anchor __asChild__>
			<div className="Row">
				Row as anchor <Popover.Trigger>Trigger</Popover.Trigger>
			</div>
		</Popover.Anchor>

		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>…</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.Row {
	background-color: gainsboro;
	padding: 20px;
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Dialog WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal).

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

#### Abstract the arrow and set default configuration

This example abstracts the `Popover.Arrow` part and sets a default `sideOffset` configuration.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Popover, PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent } from "./your-popover";

export default () => (
	<Popover>
		<PopoverTrigger>Popover trigger</PopoverTrigger>
		<PopoverContent>Popover content</PopoverContent>
	</Popover>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-popover.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover as PopoverPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
export const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;

export const PopoverContent = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => (
		<PopoverPrimitive.Portal>
			<PopoverPrimitive.Content sideOffset={5} {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				{children}
				<PopoverPrimitive.Arrow />
			</PopoverPrimitive.Content>
		</PopoverPrimitive.Portal>
	),
);
```

# Radio Group

A set of checkable buttons—known as radio buttons—where no more than one of
the buttons can be checked at a time.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-radio-group
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { RadioGroup } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<RadioGroup.Root>
		<RadioGroup.Item>
			<RadioGroup.Indicator />
		</RadioGroup.Item>
	</RadioGroup.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a radio group.

### Item

An item in the group that can be checked. An `input` will also render when used within a `form` to ensure events propagate correctly.

### Indicator

Renders when the radio item is in a checked state. You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Radio Group WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio) and uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/examples/radio) to manage focus movement among radio items.

```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { ScrollArea } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<ScrollArea.Root>
		<ScrollArea.Viewport />
		<ScrollArea.Scrollbar orientation="horizontal">
			<ScrollArea.Thumb />
		</ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
		<ScrollArea.Scrollbar orientation="vertical">
			<ScrollArea.Thumb />
		</ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
		<ScrollArea.Corner />
	</ScrollArea.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a scroll area.

### Viewport

The viewport area of the scroll area.

### Scrollbar

The vertical scrollbar. Add a second `Scrollbar` with an `orientation` prop to enable horizontal scrolling.

### Thumb

The thumb to be used in `ScrollArea.Scrollbar`.

### Corner

The corner where both vertical and horizontal scrollbars meet.

## Accessibility

In most cases, it's best to rely on native scrolling and work with the customization options available in CSS. When that isn't enough, `ScrollArea` provides additional customizability while maintaining the browser's native scroll behavior (as well as accessibility features, like keyboard scrolling).

### Keyboard Interactions

Scrolling via keyboard is supported by default because the component relies on native scrolling. Specific keyboard interactions may differ between platforms, so we do not specify them here or add specific event listeners to handle scrolling via key events.

```jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Value />
			<Select.Icon />
		</Select.Trigger>

		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.ScrollUpButton />
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item>

					<Select.Separator />
				</Select.Viewport>
				<Select.ScrollDownButton />
				<Select.Arrow />
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a select.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the select. The `Select.Content` will position itself by aligning over the trigger.

### Value

The part that reflects the selected value. By default the selected item's text will be rendered. if you require more control, you can instead control the select and pass your own `children`. It should not be styled to ensure correct positioning. An optional `placeholder` prop is also available for when the select has no value.

### Icon

A small icon often displayed next to the value as a visual affordance for the fact it can be open. By default renders ▼ but you can use your own icon via `asChild` or use `children`.

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the select is open.

### Viewport

The scrolling viewport that contains all of the items.

### Item

The component that contains the select items.

### ItemText

The textual part of the item. It should only contain the text you want to see in the trigger when that item is selected. It should not be styled to ensure correct positioning.

### ItemIndicator

Renders when the item is selected. You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

### ScrollUpButton

An optional button used as an affordance to show the viewport overflow as well as functionaly enable scrolling upwards.

### ScrollDownButton

An optional button used as an affordance to show the viewport overflow as well as functionaly enable scrolling downwards.

### Group

Used to group multiple items. use in conjunction with `Select.Label` to ensure good accessibility via automatic labelling.

### Label

Used to render the label of a group. It won't be focusable using arrow keys.

### Separator

Used to visually separate items in the select.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the content. This can be used to help visually link the trigger with the `Select.Content`. Must be rendered inside `Select.Content`. Only available when `position` is set to `popper`.

## Examples

### Change the positioning mode

By default, `Select` will behave similarly to a native MacOS menu by positioning `Select.Content` relative to the active item. If you would prefer an alternative positioning approach similar to `Popover` or `DropdownMenu` then you can set `position` to `popper` and make use of additional alignment options such as `side`, `sideOffset` and more.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content __position__="popper" __sideOffset__={5}>
				…
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content size

When using `position="popper"` on `Select.Content`, you may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-select-trigger-width` and `--radix-select-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content
				__className__="SelectContent"
				position="popper"
				sideOffset={5}
			>
				…
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.SelectContent {
	width: var(__--radix-select-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-select-content-available-height__);
}
```

### With disabled items

You can add special styles to disabled items via the `data-disabled` attribute.

```jsx line=11
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item __className__="SelectItem" __disabled__>
						…
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				</Select.Viewport>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.SelectItem[__data-disabled__] {
	color: "gainsboro";
}
```

### With a placeholder

You can use the `placeholder` prop on `Value` for when the select has no value. There's also a `data-placeholder` attribute on `Trigger` to help with styling.

```jsx line=7,8
// index.jsx
import { Select } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger __className__="SelectTrigger">
			<Select.Value __placeholder__="Pick an option" />
			<Select.Icon />
		</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>…</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css line=2
/* styles.css */
.SelectTrigger[__data-placeholder__] {
	color: "gainsboro";
}
```

### With separators

Use the `Separator` part to add a separator between items.

```jsx line=9
<Select.Root>
	<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
	<Select.Portal>
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Viewport>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Separator />
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
			</Select.Viewport>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Portal>
</Select.Root>
```

### With grouped items

Use the `Group` and `Label` parts to group items in a section.

```jsx line=6-7,11
<Select.Root>
	<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
	<Select.Portal>
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Viewport>
				<Select.Group>
					<Select.Label>Label</Select.Label>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				</Select.Group>
			</Select.Viewport>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Portal>
</Select.Root>
```

### With complex items

You can use custom content in your items.

```jsx line=11
import { Select } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item>
						<Select.ItemText>
							<img src="…" />
							Adolfo Hess
						</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item>…</Select.Item>
				</Select.Viewport>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

### Controlling the value displayed in the trigger

By default the trigger will automatically display the selected item `ItemText`'s content. You can control what appears by chosing to put things inside/outside the `ItemText` part.

If you need more flexibility, you can control the component using `value`/`onValueChange` props and passing `children` to `SelectValue`. Remember to make sure what you put in there is accessible.

```jsx line=1,4,6
const countries = { france: "🇫🇷", "united-kingdom": "🇬🇧", spain: "🇪🇸" };

export default () => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("france");
	return (
		<Select.Root __value__={value} __onValueChange__={setValue}>
			<Select.Trigger>
				<Select.Value __aria-label__={value}>
					{__countries[value]__}
				</Select.Value>
				<Select.Icon />
			</Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Viewport>
					<Select.Item value="france">
						<Select.ItemText>France</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item value="united-kingdom">
						<Select.ItemText>United Kingdom</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item value="spain">
						<Select.ItemText>Spain</Select.ItemText>
						<Select.ItemIndicator>…</Select.ItemIndicator>
					</Select.Item>
				</Select.Viewport>
			</Select.Content>
			</Select.Portal>
		</Select.Root>
	);
};
```

### With custom scrollbar

The native scrollbar is hidden by default as we recommend using the `ScrollUpButton` and `ScrollDownButton` parts for the best UX. If you do not want to use these parts, compose your select with our [Scroll Area](scroll-area) primitive.

```jsx line=10,12,18-20
// index.jsx
import { Select, ScrollArea } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Select.Root>
		<Select.Trigger>…</Select.Trigger>
		<Select.Portal>
			<Select.Content>
				<ScrollArea.Root __className__="ScrollAreaRoot" type="auto">
					<Select.Viewport __asChild__>
						<ScrollArea.Viewport __className__="ScrollAreaViewport">
							<StyledItem>…</StyledItem>
							<StyledItem>…</StyledItem>
							<StyledItem>…</StyledItem>
						</ScrollArea.Viewport>
					</Select.Viewport>
					<ScrollArea.Scrollbar
						__className__="ScrollAreaScrollbar"
						orientation="vertical"
					>
						<ScrollArea.Thumb __className__="ScrollAreaThumb" />
					</ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
				</ScrollArea.Root>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Portal>
	</Select.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.ScrollAreaRoot {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}

.ScrollAreaViewport {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}

.ScrollAreaScrollbar {
	width: 4px;
	padding: 5px 2px;
}

.ScrollAreaThumb {
	background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
	border-radius: 3px;
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [ListBox WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox).

See the W3C [Select-Only Combobox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/combobox/combobox-select-only.html) example for more information.

### Keyboard Interactions

### Labelling

Use our [Label](label) component in order to offer a visual and accessible label for the select.

```jsx line=5,8,12
import { Select, Label } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<>
		<Label>
			Country
			<Select.Root>…</Select.Root>
		</Label>

		{/* or */}

		<Label htmlFor="country">Country</Label>
		<Select.Root>
			<Select.Trigger __id__="country">…</Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Portal>
				<Select.Content>…</Select.Content>
			</Select.Portal>
		</Select.Root>
	</>
);
```

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract down to `Select` and `SelectItem`

This example abstracts most of the parts.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Select, SelectItem } from "./your-select";

export default () => (
	<Select defaultValue="2">
		<SelectItem value="1">Item 1</SelectItem>
		<SelectItem value="2">Item 2</SelectItem>
		<SelectItem value="3">Item 3</SelectItem>
	</Select>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-select.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Select as SelectPrimitive } from "radix-ui";
import {
	CheckIcon,
	ChevronDownIcon,
	ChevronUpIcon,
} from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export const Select = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<SelectPrimitive.Root {...props}>
				<SelectPrimitive.Trigger ref={forwardedRef}>
					<SelectPrimitive.Value />
					<SelectPrimitive.Icon>
						<ChevronDownIcon />
					</SelectPrimitive.Icon>
				</SelectPrimitive.Trigger>
				<SelectPrimitive.Portal>
					<SelectPrimitive.Content>
						<SelectPrimitive.ScrollUpButton>
							<ChevronUpIcon />
						</SelectPrimitive.ScrollUpButton>
						<SelectPrimitive.Viewport>{children}</SelectPrimitive.Viewport>
						<SelectPrimitive.ScrollDownButton>
							<ChevronDownIcon />
						</SelectPrimitive.ScrollDownButton>
					</SelectPrimitive.Content>
				</SelectPrimitive.Portal>
			</SelectPrimitive.Root>
		);
	},
);

export const SelectItem = React.forwardRef(
	({ children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
		return (
			<SelectPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
				<SelectPrimitive.ItemText>{children}</SelectPrimitive.ItemText>
				<SelectPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
					<CheckIcon />
				</SelectPrimitive.ItemIndicator>
			</SelectPrimitive.Item>
		);
	},
);
```

## Slider

An input where the user selects a value from within a given range.

# Slider

An input where the user selects a value from within a given range.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-slider
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the parts of a slider. It will render an `input` for each thumb when used within a `form` to ensure events propagate correctly.

### Track

The track that contains the `Slider.Range`.

### Range

The range part. Must live inside `Slider.Track`.

### Thumb

A draggable thumb. You can render multiple thumbs.

## Examples

### Vertical orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to create a vertical slider.

```jsx line=6
// index.jsx
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root
		className="SliderRoot"
		defaultValue={[50]}
		__orientation__="vertical"
	>
		<Slider.Track className="SliderTrack">
			<Slider.Range className="SliderRange" />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb className="SliderThumb" />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

```css line=7,18,26
/* styles.css */
.SliderRoot {
	position: relative;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
}
.SliderRoot[__data-orientation="vertical"__] {
	flex-direction: column;
	width: 20px;
	height: 100px;
}

.SliderTrack {
	position: relative;
	flex-grow: 1;
	background-color: grey;
}
.SliderTrack[__data-orientation="vertical"__] {
	width: 3px;
}

.SliderRange {
	position: absolute;
	background-color: black;
}
.SliderRange[__data-orientation="vertical"__] {
	width: 100%;
}

.SliderThumb {
	display: block;
	width: 20px;
	height: 20px;
	background-color: black;
}
```

### Create a range

Add multiple thumbs and values to create a range slider.

```jsx line=4,8-9
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root defaultValue={__[25, 75]__}>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

### Define step size

Use the `step` prop to increase the stepping interval.

```jsx line=4
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root defaultValue={[50]} __step__={10}>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

### Prevent thumb overlap

Use `minStepsBetweenThumbs` to avoid thumbs with equal values.

```jsx line=4
import { Slider } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slider.Root defaultValue={[25, 75]} step={10} __minStepsBetweenThumbs__={1}>
		<Slider.Track>
			<Slider.Range />
		</Slider.Track>
		<Slider.Thumb />
		<Slider.Thumb />
	</Slider.Root>
);
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Slider WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb).

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract all parts

This example abstracts all of the `Slider` parts so it can be used as a self closing element.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Slider } from "./your-slider";

export default () => <Slider defaultValue={[25]} />;
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-slider.jsx
import { Slider as SliderPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Slider = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
	const value = props.value || props.defaultValue;

	return (
		<SliderPrimitive.Slider {...props} ref={forwardedRef}>
			<SliderPrimitive.Track>
				<SliderPrimitive.Range />
			</SliderPrimitive.Track>
			{value.map((_, i) => (
				<SliderPrimitive.Thumb key={i} />
			))}
		</SliderPrimitive.Slider>
	);
});
```

## Caveats

### Mouse events are not fired

Because of [a limitation](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/blob/83a8c13bf66f3d9f17d77caeb187a69eb146930b/packages/react/slider/src/Slider.tsx#L383-L384) we faced during implementation, the following example won't work as expected and the `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` event handlers won't be fired:

```jsx
<Slider.Root
	onMouseDown={() => console.log("onMouseDown")}
	onMouseUp={() => console.log("onMouseUp")}
>
	…
</Slider.Root>
```

We recommend using pointer events instead (eg. `onPointerDown`, `onPointerUp`). Regardless of the above limitation, these events are better suited for cross-platform/device handling as they are fired for all pointer input types (mouse, touch, pen, etc.).

## Toast

A succinct message that is displayed temporarily.

# Toast

A succinct message that is displayed temporarily.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toast
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Toast } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Toast.Provider>
		<Toast.Root>
			<Toast.Title />
			<Toast.Description />
			<Toast.Action />
			<Toast.Close />
		</Toast.Root>

		<Toast.Viewport />
	</Toast.Provider>
);
```

## API Reference

### Provider

The provider that wraps your toasts and toast viewport. It usually wraps the application.

### Viewport

The fixed area where toasts appear. Users can jump to the viewport by pressing a hotkey. It is up to you to ensure the discoverability of the hotkey for keyboard users.

### Root

The toast that automatically closes. It should not be held open to [acquire a user response](/primitives/docs/components/toast#action).

### Title

An optional title for the toast.

### Description

The toast message.

### Action

An action that is safe to ignore to ensure users are not expected to complete tasks with unexpected side effects as a result of a [time limit](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html).

When obtaining a user response is necessary, portal an [`AlertDialog`](/primitives/docs/components/alert-dialog) styled as a toast into the viewport instead.

### Close

A button that allows users to dismiss the toast before its duration has elapsed.

## Examples

### Custom hotkey

Override the default hotkey using the `event.code` value for each key from [keycode.info](https://keycode.info/).

```jsx line=3
<Toast.Provider>
	{/* ... */}
	<Toast.Viewport __hotkey__={["altKey", "KeyT"]} />
</Toast.Provider>
```

### Custom duration

Customise the duration of a toast to override the provider value.

```jsx line=1
<Toast.Root __duration__={3000}>
	<Toast.Description>Saved!</Toast.Description>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Duplicate toasts

When a toast must appear every time a user clicks a button, use state to render multiple instances of the same toast (see below). Alternatively, you can abstract the parts to create your own [imperative API](/primitives/docs/components/toast#imperative-api).

```jsx line=6,11-15
export default () => {
	const [savedCount, setSavedCount] = React.useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<form onSubmit={() => setSavedCount((count) => count + 1)}>
				{/* ... */}
				<button>save</button>
			</form>

			{Array.from({ length: savedCount }).map((_, index) => (
				<Toast.Root key={index}>
					<Toast.Description>Saved!</Toast.Description>
				</Toast.Root>
			))}
		</div>
	);
};
```

### Animating swipe gesture

Combine `--radix-toast-swipe-move-[x|y]` and `--radix-toast-swipe-end-[x|y]` CSS variables with `data-swipe="[start|move|cancel|end]"` attributes to animate a swipe to close gesture. Here's an example:

```jsx line=6,7
// index.jsx
import { Toast } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Toast.Provider __swipeDirection__="right">
		<Toast.Root __className__="ToastRoot">...</Toast.Root>
		<Toast.Viewport />
	</Toast.Provider>
);
```

```css line=2,3,5,9,15
/* styles.css */
.ToastRoot[__data-swipe__="move"] {
	transform: translateX(var(__--radix-toast-swipe-move-x__));
}
.ToastRoot[__data-swipe__="cancel"] {
	transform: translateX(0);
	transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}
.ToastRoot[__data-swipe__="end"] {
	animation: slideRight 100ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideRight {
	from {
		transform: translateX(var(__--radix-toast-swipe-end-x__));
	}
	to {
		transform: translateX(100%);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [`aria-live` requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-live).

### Sensitivity

Control the sensitivity of the toast for screen readers using the `type` prop.

For toasts that are the result of a user action, choose `foreground`. Toasts generated from background tasks should use `background`.

#### Foreground

Foreground toasts are announced immediately. Assistive technologies may choose to clear previously queued messages when a foreground toast appears. Try to avoid stacking distinct foreground toasts at the same time.

#### Background

Background toasts are announced at the next graceful opportunity, for example, when the screen reader has finished reading its current sentence. They do not clear queued messages so overusing them can be perceived as a laggy user experience for screen reader users when used in response to a user interaction.

```jsx line=1,6
<Toast.Root type="foreground">
	<Toast.Description>File removed successfully.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>

<Toast.Root type="background">
	<Toast.Description>We've just released Radix 1.0.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Alternative action

Use the `altText` prop on the `Action` to instruct an alternative way of actioning the toast to screen reader users.

You can direct the user to a permanent place in your application where they can action it or implement your own custom hotkey logic. If implementing the latter, use `foreground` type to announce immediately and increase the duration to give the user ample time.

```jsx line=4,10,12
<Toast.Root type="background">
	<Toast.Title>Upgrade Available!</Toast.Title>
	<Toast.Description>We've just released Radix 1.0.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Action altText="Goto account settings to upgrade">
		Upgrade
	</Toast.Action>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>

<Toast.Root __type__="foreground" __duration__={10000}>
	<Toast.Description>File removed successfully.</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Action altText="Undo (Alt+U)">
		Undo <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>
	</Toast.Action>
	<Toast.Close>Dismiss</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Close icon button

When providing an icon (or font icon), remember to label it correctly for screen reader users.

```jsx line=3-4
<Toast.Root type="foreground">
	<Toast.Description>Saved!</Toast.Description>
	<Toast.Close aria-label="Close">
		<span aria-hidden>×</span>
	</Toast.Close>
</Toast.Root>
```

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

### Abstract parts

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Toast } from "./your-toast";

export default () => (
	<Toast title="Upgrade available" content="We've just released Radix 3.0!">
		<button onClick={handleUpgrade}>Upgrade</button>
	</Toast>
);
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-toast.jsx
import { Toast as ToastPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Toast = ({ title, content, children, ...props }) => {
	return (
		<ToastPrimitive.Root {...props}>
			{title && <ToastPrimitive.Title>{title}</ToastPrimitive.Title>}
			<ToastPrimitive.Description>{content}</ToastPrimitive.Description>
			{children && (
				<ToastPrimitive.Action asChild>{children}</ToastPrimitive.Action>
			)}
			<ToastPrimitive.Close aria-label="Close">
				<span aria-hidden>×</span>
			</ToastPrimitive.Close>
		</ToastPrimitive.Root>
	);
};
```

### Imperative API

Create your own imperative API to allow [toast duplication](/primitives/docs/components/toast#duplicate-toasts) if preferred.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Toast } from "./your-toast";

export default () => {
	const savedRef = React.useRef();
	return (
		<div>
			<form onSubmit={() => savedRef.current.publish()}>
				{/* ... */}
				<button>Save</button>
			</form>
			<Toast ref={savedRef}>Saved successfully!</Toast>
		</div>
	);
};
```

#### Implementation

```jsx
// your-toast.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Toast as ToastPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export const Toast = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
	const { children, ...toastProps } = props;
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

	React.useImperativeHandle(forwardedRef, () => ({
		publish: () => setCount((count) => count + 1),
	}));

	return (
		<>
			{Array.from({ length: count }).map((_, index) => (
				<ToastPrimitive.Root key={index} {...toastProps}>
					<ToastPrimitive.Description>{children}</ToastPrimitive.Description>
					<ToastPrimitive.Close>Dismiss</ToastPrimitive.Close>
				</ToastPrimitive.Root>
			))}
		</>
	);
});
```

A container for grouping a set of controls, such as buttons, toggle groups or dropdown menus.

# Toolbar

A container for grouping a set of controls, such as buttons, toggle groups or
dropdown menus.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toolbar
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Toolbar } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Toolbar.Root>
		<Toolbar.Button />
		<Toolbar.Separator />
		<Toolbar.Link />
		<Toolbar.ToggleGroup>
			<Toolbar.ToggleItem />
		</Toolbar.ToggleGroup>
	</Toolbar.Root>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all the toolbar component parts.

### Button

A button item.

### Link

A link item.

### ToggleGroup

A set of two-state buttons that can be toggled on or off.

### ToggleItem

An item in the group.

### Separator

Used to visually separate items in the toolbar.

## Examples

### Use with other primitives

All our primitives which expose a `Trigger` part, such as `Dialog`, `AlertDialog`, `Popover`, `DropdownMenu` can be composed within a toolbar by using the [`asChild` prop](/primitives/docs/guides/composition).

Here is an example using our `DropdownMenu` primitive.

```jsx line=8-10
import { Toolbar, DropdownMenu } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Toolbar.Root>
		<Toolbar.Button>Action 1</Toolbar.Button>
		<Toolbar.Separator />
		<DropdownMenu.Root>
			<Toolbar.Button __asChild__>
				<DropdownMenu.Trigger>Trigger</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
			</Toolbar.Button>
			<DropdownMenu.Content>…</DropdownMenu.Content>
		</DropdownMenu.Root>
	</Toolbar.Root>
);
```

## Accessibility

Uses [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/examples/radio/radio.html) to manage focus movement among items.

### Keyboard Interactions

---

## Tooltip

A popup that displays information related to an element when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.

# Tooltip

A popup that displays information related to an element when the element
receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Provider>
		<Tooltip.Root>
			<Tooltip.Trigger />
			<Tooltip.Portal>
				<Tooltip.Content>
					<Tooltip.Arrow />
				</Tooltip.Content>
			</Tooltip.Portal>
		</Tooltip.Root>
	</Tooltip.Provider>
);
```

## API Reference

### Provider

Wraps your app to provide global functionality to your tooltips.

### Root

Contains all the parts of a tooltip.

### Trigger

The button that toggles the tooltip. By default, the `Tooltip.Content` will position itself against the trigger.

### Portal

When used, portals the content part into the `body`.

### Content

The component that pops out when the tooltip is open.

### Arrow

An optional arrow element to render alongside the tooltip. This can be used to help visually link the trigger with the `Tooltip.Content`. Must be rendered inside `Tooltip.Content`.

## Examples

### Configure globally

Use the `Provider` to control `delayDuration` and `skipDelayDuration` globally.

```jsx line=4
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Provider __delayDuration__={800} __skipDelayDuration__={500}>
		<Tooltip.Root>
			<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
			<Tooltip.Content>…</Tooltip.Content>
		</Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Root>
			<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
			<Tooltip.Content>…</Tooltip.Content>
		</Tooltip.Root>
	</Tooltip.Provider>
);
```

### Show instantly

Use the `delayDuration` prop to control the time it takes for the tooltip to open.

```jsx line=4
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root __delayDuration__={0}>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Content>…</Tooltip.Content>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

### Constrain the content size

You may want to constrain the width of the content so that it matches the trigger width. You may also want to constrain its height to not exceed the viewport.

We expose several CSS custom properties such as `--radix-tooltip-trigger-width` and `--radix-tooltip-content-available-height` to support this. Use them to constrain the content dimensions.

```jsx line=9
// index.jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Portal>
			<Tooltip.Content __className__="TooltipContent" sideOffset={5}>
				…
			</Tooltip.Content>
		</Tooltip.Portal>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.TooltipContent {
	width: var(__--radix-tooltip-trigger-width__);
	max-height: var(__--radix-tooltip-content-available-height__);
}
```

### Origin-aware animations

We expose a CSS custom property `--radix-tooltip-content-transform-origin`. Use it to animate the content from its computed origin based on `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`, `alignOffset` and any collisions.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Content __className__="TooltipContent">…</Tooltip.Content>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

```css line=3-4
/* styles.css */
.TooltipContent {
	transform-origin: var(--radix-tooltip-content-transform-origin);
	animation: scaleIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: scale(0);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: scale(1);
	}
}
```

### Collision-aware animations

We expose `data-side` and `data-align` attributes. Their values will change at runtime to reflect collisions. Use them to create collision and direction-aware animations.

```jsx line=8
// index.jsx
import { Tooltip } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip.Root>
		<Tooltip.Trigger>…</Tooltip.Trigger>
		<Tooltip.Content __className__="TooltipContent">…</Tooltip.Content>
	</Tooltip.Root>
);
```

```css line=6,9
/* styles.css */
.TooltipContent {
	animation-duration: 0.6s;
	animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
.TooltipContent[data-side="top"] {
	animation-name: slideUp;
}
.TooltipContent[data-side="bottom"] {
	animation-name: slideDown;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}

@keyframes slideUp {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(10px);
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

## Custom APIs

Create your own API by abstracting the primitive parts into your own component.

### Abstract parts and introduce a content prop

This example abstracts all of the `Tooltip` parts and introduces a new `content` prop.

#### Usage

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "./your-tooltip";

export default () => (
	<Tooltip content="Tooltip content">
		<button>Tooltip trigger</button>
	</Tooltip>
);
```

#### Implementation

Use the [`asChild` prop](/primitives/docs/guides/composition) to convert the trigger part into a slottable area. It will replace the trigger with the child that gets passed to it.

```jsx line=8-10
// your-tooltip.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Tooltip as TooltipPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

export function Tooltip({
	children,
	content,
	open,
	defaultOpen,
	onOpenChange,
	...props
}) {
	return (
		<TooltipPrimitive.Root
			open={open}
			defaultOpen={defaultOpen}
			onOpenChange={onOpenChange}
		>
			<TooltipPrimitive.Trigger __asChild__>
				{children}
			</TooltipPrimitive.Trigger>
			<TooltipPrimitive.Content side="top" align="center" {...props}>
				{content}
				<TooltipPrimitive.Arrow width={11} height={5} />
			</TooltipPrimitive.Content>
		</TooltipPrimitive.Root>
	);
}
```

# Utilities

## Accessible Icon

Makes icons accessible by adding a label.

# Accessible Icon

Makes icons accessible by adding a label.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-accessible-icon
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { AccessibleIcon } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <AccessibleIcon.Root />;
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains the icon to make accessible.

## Accessibility

Most icons or icon systems come with no accessibility built-in. For example, the same visual **cross** icon may in fact mean **"close"** or **"delete"**. This component lets you give meaning to icons used throughout your app.

This is built with [Visually Hidden](../utilities/visually-hidden).

## Direction Provider

Wraps your app to provide global reading direction.

# Direction Provider

Wraps your app to provide global reading direction.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-direction
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Direction } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <Direction.Provider />;
```

## API Reference

### Provider

When creating localized apps that require right-to-left (RTL) reading direction, you need to wrap your application with the `Direction.Provider` component to ensure all of the primitives adjust their behavior based on the `dir` prop.

## Example

Use the direction provider.

```jsx
import { Direction } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Direction.Provider dir="rtl">{/* your app */}</Direction.Provider>
);
```

---

## Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

# Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-portal
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Portal } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <Portal.Root />;
```

## Basic example

Use the portal primitive.

```jsx
import { Portal } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <Portal.Root>Content</Portal.Root>;
```

## API Reference

### Root

Anything you put inside this component will be rendered in a separate `<div>` element. By default, this element will be appended to `document.body` but you can choose a different container by using the `container` prop.

---

## Slot

Merges its props onto its immediate child.

# Slot

Merges its props onto its immediate child.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slot.Root>
		<div>Hello</div>
	</Slot.Root>
);
```

## Basic example

Use to create your own `asChild` API.

When your component has a single children element:

```jsx line=9
// your-button.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

function Button({ asChild, ...props }) {
	const Comp = asChild ? Slot.Root : "button";
	return <Comp {...props} />;
}
```

Use `Slottable` when your component has multiple children to pass the props to the correct element:

```jsx
// your-button.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

function Button({ asChild, children, leftElement, rightElement, ...props }) {
	const Comp = asChild ? Slot.Root : "button";
	return (
		<Comp {...props}>
			{leftElement}
			<Slot.Slottable>{children}</Slot.Slottable>
			{rightElement}
		</Comp>
	);
}
```

### Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from "./your-button";

export default () => (
	<Button asChild>
		<a href="/contact">Contact</a>
	</Button>
);
```

### Event handlers

Any prop that starts with `on` (e.g., `onClick`) is considered an event handler.

When merging event handlers, `Slot` will create a new function where the child handler takes precedence over the slot handler.

If one of the event handlers relies on `event.defaultPrevented` make sure that the order is correct.

```jsx
import { Slot } from "radix-ui";

export default () => (
	<Slot.Root
		onClick={(event) => {
			if (!event.defaultPrevented)
				console.log("Not logged because default is prevented.");
		}}
	>
		<button onClick={(event) => event.preventDefault()} />
	</Slot.Root>
);
```

## Visually Hidden

Hides content from the screen in an accessible way.

# Visually Hidden

Hides content from the screen in an accessible way.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-visually-hidden
```

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from "radix-ui";

export default () => <VisuallyHidden.Root />;
```

## Basic example

Use the visually hidden primitive.

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from "radix-ui";
import { GearIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

export default () => (
	<button>
		<GearIcon />
		<VisuallyHidden.Root>Settings</VisuallyHidden.Root>
	</button>
);
```

## API Reference

### Root

Anything you put inside this component will be hidden from the screen but will be announced by screen readers.

## Accessibility

This is useful in certain scenarios as an alternative to traditional labelling with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

# Radix Themes - Complete Documentation

> Radix Themes is a styled component library built on Radix Primitives with a beautiful default theme.

# Overview

## Getting started

Install Radix Themes and start building in minutes

# Getting started

Install Radix Themes and start building in minutes.

Radix Themes is a pre-styled component library that is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration. If you are looking for the unstyled components, go to [Radix Primitives](/primitives).

## Installation

Getting up and running is quick and easy.

### 1. Install Radix Themes

Install the package from your command line.

### 2. Import the CSS file

Import the global CSS file at the root of your application.

```ts
import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
```

### 3. Add the Theme component

Add `Theme` to your application, wrapping the root component inside of `body`.

```jsx line=7,9
import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export default function () {
	return (
		<html>
			<body>
				<Theme>
					<MyApp />
				</Theme>
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

### 4. Start building

You are now ready to use Radix Themes components.

```jsx
import { Flex, Text, Button } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export default function MyApp() {
	return (
		<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
			<Text>Hello from Radix Themes :)</Text>
			<Button>Let's go</Button>
		</Flex>
	);
}
```

## Customizing your theme

Configuration is managed and applied via the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) component.

### Basic configuration

Pass [configuration](/themes/docs/components/theme) to the `Theme` to customize appearance.

```jsx line=1
<Theme accentColor="crimson" grayColor="sand" radius="large" scaling="95%">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

### Using the theme panel

`ThemePanel` is a drop-in component that allows you to preview the theme in real time. Visit the [component playground](/themes/playground) to see it in action.

To add `ThemePanel` to your app, import it from the package and drop it inside your root `Theme`.

```jsx line=7
import { Theme, ThemePanel } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export default function () {
	return (
		<Theme>
			<MyApp />
			<ThemePanel />
		</Theme>
	);
}
```

## Layout

Get the layout concerns right.

# Layout

Get the layout concerns right.

## Layout components

Layout components are used to separate layout responsibilities from content and interactivity. This is _the_ separation of concerns that makes your app maintainable and easy to reason about, and understanding these principles is key to building your interfaces effectively.

### Box

[Box](/themes/docs/components/box) is the most fundamental layout component. Box is used to:

- Provide spacing to child elements.
- Impose sizing constraints on content.
- Control layout behaviour within flex and grid containers.
- Hide content based on screen size using its responsive `display` prop.

### Flex

[Flex](/themes/docs/components/flex) component does everything that Box can do, but comes with an additional set of props to organize items along an axis. It provides convenient access to the CSS [flexbox properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### Grid

[Grid](/themes/docs/components/grid) is used to organize the content in columns and rows. Like Box and Flex, it’s made to provide convenient access to the underlying CSS [grid properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) without any magic of its own.

### Section

[Section](/themes/docs/components/section) provides a consistent vertical spacing between the larger parts of your page content, creating a sense of hierarchy and separation. There’s just a few pre-defined sizes for different spacing levels to keep things simple and consistent.

### Container

[Container](/themes/docs/components/container)’s sole responsibility is to provide a consistent `max-width` to the content it wraps. Like Section, it comes just with a couple of pre-defined sizes that work well with common breakpoints and typical content widths for comfortable reading.

***

## Common layout props

Each layout component has a set of it’s own specialized props and also a shared set of common layout props. All layout props support [responsive object values](/themes/docs/theme/breakpoints).

### Padding

Padding props can access the [space scale steps](/themes/docs/theme/spacing) or accept any valid [CSS padding value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding).

```jsx
<Box p="4" />
<Box p="100px">
<Box p={{ sm: '6', lg: '9' }}>
```

### Width

Width props accept any valid [CSS width value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width).

```jsx
<Box width="100px" />
<Box width={{ md: '100vw', xl: '1400px' }} />
```

### Height

Height props accept any valid [CSS height value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height).

```jsx
<Box height="100px" />
<Box height={{ md: '100vh', xl: '600px' }} />
```

### Positioning

Positioning props can change how the element is placed relative to the normal flow of the document. As usual, the corresponding CSS values are accepted for each property, and the [space scale steps](/themes/docs/theme/spacing) can be used for the offset values.

```jsx
<Box position="relative" />
<Box position={{ initial: "relative", lg: "sticky" }} />

<Box inset="4" />
<Box inset={{ initial: "0", xl: "auto" }} />

<Box left="4" />
<Box left={{ initial: "0", xl: "auto" }} />
```

### Flex children

Each layout component has props used to control the style when it is a child of a flex container.

```jsx
<Box flexBasis="100%" />
<Box flexShrink="0">
<Box flexGrow={{ initial: "0", lg: "1" }} />
```

### Grid children

Each layout component has props used to control the style when it is a child of a grid container.

```jsx
<Box gridArea="header" />

<Box gridColumn="1 / 3" />
<Box gridColumnStart="2">
<Box gridColumnEnd={{ initial: "-1", md: "3", lg: "auto" }} />

<Box gridRow="1 / 3" />
<Box gridRowStart="2">
<Box gridRowEnd={{ initial: "-1", md: "3", lg: "auto" }} />
```

***

## Margin props

Margin props are available on most components in order to provide spacing around the elements. They are not exclusive to layout components.

Margin props can access the [space scale steps](/themes/docs/theme/spacing) or accept any valid [CSS margin value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)

```jsx
<Button m="4" />
<Button m="100px">
<Button m={{ sm: '6', lg: '9' }}>
```

The margin props may be unavailable on components that don’t render a HTML node or rely on their Root part for layout.

***

## Standalone usage

If needed, it’s possible to use _just_ the layout component from Radix Themes. Just make sure that JavaScript tree-shaking works on your side, and import the CSS that powers the layout styles:

```jsx
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout.css";
```

You’ll still have to wrap your app with `Theme` to provide the space scale and scaling factor settings.

### Upgrade guide

This release introduces a number of breaking changes. Please follow the steps below to upgrade.

#### General

- Multi-part components now don’t export named parts anymore. Use dot notation instead, which was revised to work with React Server Components. For example:
  - `DialogRoot` → `Dialog.Root`
  - `DialogTrigger` → `Dialog.Trigger`
  - `DialogContent` → `Dialog.Content`
  - …and so on for all multi-part components:
    - `AlertDialog`
    - `Callout`
    - `ContextMenu`
    - `Dialog`
    - `DropdownMenu`
    - `HoverCard`
    - `Popover`
    - `RadioGroup`
    - `Select`
    - `Table`
    - `Tabs`
    - `TextField`
- Package internals such as prop definitions and helpers are no longer available from the root `@radix-ui/themes` import entry point.
  - Import them from `@radix-ui/themes/props` and `@radix-ui/themes/helpers` instead.

#### Props

- The `width` and `height` props on layout components don't map to space scale anymore. Find and replace your `width` and `height` prop usage with the corresponding [space scale](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/space.css) steps:
  - `width="1"` → `width="4px"`
  - `width="2"` → `width="8px"`
  - `width="3"` → `width="12px"`
  - `width="4"` → `width="16px"`
  - `width="5"` → `width="24px"`
  - `width="6"` → `width="32px"`
  - `width="7"` → `width="40px"`
  - `width="8"` → `width="48px"`
  - `width="9"` → `width="64px"`
  - …and so on for `height`
  - Make sure to update responsive object syntax as well
  - You can also use `var(--space-1)` to `var(--space-9)` instead of hardcoded values.
- The `shrink` and `grow` props on layout components were renamed
  - `shrink` → `flexShrink`
  - `grow` → `flexGrow`

#### Colors

If you were using the following tokens for your custom components, make sure to replace the corresponding references.

- `--color-surface-accent` → `--accent-surface`
- Contrast colors were renamed:
  - `--accent-9-contrast` → `--accent-contrast`
  - `--red-9-contrast` → `--red-contrast`
  - `--pink-9-contrast` → `--pink-contrast`
  - `--blue-9-contrast` → `--blue-contrast`
  - …and so on for all scales
- Added a new focus color scale. Rename the following tokens:
  - `--color-autofill-root` → `--focus-a3`
  - `--color-focus-root` → `--focus-8`
  - `--color-selection-root` → `--focus-a5`
- `--gray-2-translucent` and the corresponding tinted gray colors were removed.
  - Use `--color-panel-translucent` in combination with a backdrop blur filter instead.

#### Components

- `AlertDialog`, `Dialog` now have `maxWidth="600px"` by default on the Content part.
  - This is slightly larger than the previous `580px` value. If you use dialogs that need a different width, override `maxWidth` with your own value.
- `Badge` has a new `size="3"`, `size="2"` is now much smaller, and `size="1"` dimensions were tweaked
  - Replace your `size="2"` usage with `size="3"`
- `Card` internal HTML structure and styles were reworked and now renders a single HTML node. Make sure that your code works as expected if you were relying on any of the implementation quirks to override styles or behaviour.
  - If you need to override the Card’s background color on variants other than `ghost`, use `--card-background-color` variable instead of assigning `background-color` directly, or set your background color on an `<Inset p="current">` element nested as the first child of the Card.
  - Check your Card instances that uses `asChild` or is `asChild`’ed onto by a parent component. (The common case with link or button card without any extra styles will work as expected).
- `HoverCard` and `Popover` now have `maxWidth="480px"` by default on the Content part.
  - If you use popovers and hover cards that need a wider width, override `maxWidth` with your own value.
- `RadioGroup` internal HTML structure and styles were reworked and is now designed to display an optional text label when passing `children` to the `Item` part. The `Root` part now also provides flex column styles and spacing.
  - If you need lower-level control, you can use the `Radio` component instead
- `Section` has a new `size="3"`
  - Update all your Sections that used `size="3"` to `size="4"`
- `Tabs` underlying letter/word spacing CSS variables were renamed to support both `Tabs` and `TabNav` components. If you were using them, rename them to the new values:
  - `--tabs-trigger-active-letter-spacing` → `--tab-active-letter-spacing`
  - `--tabs-trigger-active-word-spacing` → `--tab-active-word-spacing`
  - `--tabs-trigger-inactive-letter-spacing` → `--tab-inactive-letter-spacing`
  - `--tabs-trigger-inactive-word-spacing` → `--tab-inactive-word-spacing`
- `TextField` now only has 2 parts: `Root` and `Slot`, dropping the `Input` part and simplifying how props are forwarded.
  - All `TextField.Input` parts used **without** `TextField.Root` should be renamed to `TextField.Root`
  - All `TextField.Input` parts used **within** `TextField.Root` should be removed and their props should be put directly on the `TextField.Root` part
  - All `TextField.Slot` parts placed to the right of `TextField.Input` will need `side="right"` prop. However, no adjustment is needed when two slots were used within one `TextField`, e.g. one slot on the left and another one on the right. In that case, the slots will be automatically placed on different sides.
  - Make sure that your code works as expected if you were relying on any of the implementation quirks to override styles or behaviour.
- `Theme` does not set body background color automatically anymore. The background color is now provided by the root `Theme` by default. The CSS variable `--color-page-background` is no longer available.
  - In most cases, it can be safely replaced with `--color-background` available on the `.radix-themes` element.
- `Tooltip` now has `maxWidth="360px"` by default on the Content part.
  - If you use tooltips that need to be wider, override `maxWidth` with your own value.

### Full changelog

- General
  - Package structure
    - Improve ESM compatibility
    - Improve tree-shaking of individual component parts
    - **\[Breaking]** Drop named exports for multi-part components
      - Note: Our new approach allows dot notation to work reliably in server components too
    - **\[Breaking]** Remove component prop definitions and internal helpers from the root `@radix-ui/themes` import entry point and export them from `@radix-ui/themes/props` and `@radix-ui/themes/helpers` to make it possible to build your own component library on top of Radix Themes using the same techniques.
    - Add a wildcard entry point to the package to allow direct access to the package internals as an escape hatch if you have a complex tooling setup that can’t support modern module resolution rules
    - Add extra CSS file exports for advanced use-cases:
      - Export individual `tokens.css`, `components.css`, and `utilities.css` files in case you need fine-grained control of the CSS precedence. For example, this allows to import Radix Themes `utilities.css` after your own CSS, and everything else before that.
      - Additionally to the above, you can customise which colors to import. Instead of importing `tokens.css`, you can also import `tokens/base.css` and `tokens/colors/*.css`, where `*` corresponds to the names of the accent and gray colors you need in your project.
      - Export `layout.css` that only includes styles for the layout components (Box, Flex, Grid, Container, Section). Individual exports `layout/tokens.css`, `layout/components.css`, and `layout/utilities.css` are also available to support the above use-case.
  - Props
    - Add the following props to all layout components:
      - `minWidth`, `maxWidth`
      - `minHeight`, `maxHeight`
      - `flexBasis`, `flexShrink`, `flexGrow`
      - `gridColumn`, `gridColumnStart`, `gridColumnEnd`
      - `gridRow`, `gridRowStart`, `gridRowEnd`
      - `overflow`, `overflowX`, `overflowY`
    - Rework all layout props to allow arbitrary CSS values, including when used with the responsive object syntax. Props that support arbitrary values include:
      - `width`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`
      - `height`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`
      - `m`, `mx`, `my`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml`
      - `p`, `px`, `py`, `pt`, `pr`, `pb`, `pl`
      - `inset`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
      - `gap`, `gapX`, `gapY`
      - `flexBasis`, `flexShrink`, `flexGrow`
      - `gridColumn`, `gridColumnStart`, `gridColumnEnd`
      - `gridRow`, `gridRowStart`, `gridRowEnd`
    - **\[Breaking]** The `width` and `height` props don't map to space scale anymore. This is because in the vast majority of cases, width and height were not set to space scale, and with that, space scale as an IDE autocomplete suggestion felt odd/misleading.
    - **\[Breaking]** Rename `shrink` and `grow` props to `flexShrink` and `flexGrow`
    - Update the type signature of the layout props so that code editor suggestions use just space scale values when possible. CSS keywords and other values such as `"auto"` or `"100vw"` are still available as manual string values.
    - Document all layout props with JSDoc
    - Fix an issue with responsive props when using a breakpoints object without the `initial` key would not apply the default prop value
    - Remove the native `color`, `defaultValue`, and `defaultChecked` attributes from components that inherit them from the native HTML elements to avoid confusion with their custom implementations
    - **\[Breaking]** Rework the availability of `asChild` prop on all components and parts
  - Colors
    - Make sure `highContrast` text colors work consistently when nested within other components that accept an accent color
    - Tweak the background color of all `variant="soft"` menu items
    - **\[Breaking]** Rename `--color-surface-accent` to `--accent-surface`
    - **\[Breaking]** Rename `--accent-9-contrast`, `--red-9-contrast`, `--pink-9-contrast`, `--blue-9-contrast`, etc. to `--accent-contrast`, `--red-contrast`, `--pink-contrast`, `--blue-contrast` and so on.
    - Remove `--gray-2-translucent` and the corresponding tinted gray colors
    - Tweak `--color-surface` and `--color-panel-translucent` values
    - **\[Breaking]** Replace `--color-focus-root`, `--color-selection-root`, `--color-autofill-root` with a focus color scale, e.g. `--focus-1` – `--focus-12`, and `--focus-a1` – `--focus-a12`.

  - Scale the underline thickness relative to the font size for `variant="outline"` and `variant="surface"`.
- `RadioGroup`
  - **\[Breaking]** Improve layout so that wrapping a radiobutton in `Text` component automatically aligns the radiobutton with the first line of the text.
    - **\[Upgrade guide]** Make sure that your layouts with radio buttons look as expected. If not, wrap your radio buttons in `<Text as="label" size="...">`, using your preferred text size.
  - **\[Breaking]** Rework sizes – add a smaller `size="1"`, change the default size to `size="2"`, add a more refined `size="3"`.

  - Refine padding values for a more balanced look.
    - Use matching scroll margins for a nicer typing experience when the `TextArea` overflows.
  - Refine how the inner shadows are applied so that they blend with the background outside of the component.
  - Refine and normalise the look and feel of disabled and read-only states.
  - Fix a Safari bug when the text value would appear tinted in the disabled input.
  - Improve autofill styles.
- `TextField`
  - Reset `z-index` of the container to avoid potential stacking issues.
  - Refine padding values for a more balanced look.
    - Use `text-indent` instead of `padding-left` so that long values aren't truncated on the left when the cursor is at the end of the input.
  - Refine how the inner shadows are applied so that they blend with the background outside of the component.
  - Refine and normalise the look and feel of disabled and read-only states.
  - Fix a Safari bug when the text value would appear tinted in the disabled input.
  - Remove ellipsis truncation, as this prevented long values from being shown when scrolling on the input horizontally in Chrome.
  - Improve autofill styles.
- `ThemePanel`
  - Disable transitions when changing the appearance.
  - Improve contrast in the border radius preview.
- `Tooltip`
  - Reduce border radius when theme setting is `radius="full"`.

## Styling

How to approach styling with Radix Themes.

# Styling

How to approach styling with Radix Themes.

## Introduction

Radix Themes does not come with a built-in styling system. There’s no `css` or `sx` prop, and it does not use any styling libraries internally. Under the hood, it’s built with vanilla CSS.

There’s no overhead when it comes to picking a styling technology for your app.

## What you get

The components in Radix Themes are relatively closed—they come with a set of styles that aren’t always easily overridden. They are customizable within what’s allowed by their props and the theme configuration.

However, you also get access to the same CSS variables that power the Radix Themes components. You can use these tokens to create custom components that naturally feel at home in the original theme. Changes to the token system are treated as breaking.

For more information on specific tokens, refer to the corresponding guides in the [Theme section](/themes/docs/theme/overview).

## Overriding styles

Beyond simple style overrides, we recommend using the components as-is, or create your own versions using the same building blocks.

Most components do have `className` and `style` props, but if you find yourself needing to override a lot of styles, it’s a good sign that you should either:

- Try to achieve what you need with the existing props and theme configuration.
- See whether you can achieve your design by tweaking the underlying token system.
- Create your own component using lower-level building blocks, such [Primitives](/primitives) and [Colors](/colors).
- Reconsider whether Radix Themes is the right fit for your project.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is _great_. Yet, if you plan to use Radix Themes with Tailwind, keep in mind how its ergonomics may encourage you to create complex styles on the fly, sometimes reaching into the component internals without friction.

Tailwind is a different styling paradigm, which may not mix well with the idea of a closed component system where customization is achieved through props, tokens, and creating new components on top of a shared set of building blocks.

## Custom components

If you need to create a custom component, use the same building blocks that Radix Themes uses:

- [Theme](/themes/docs/theme/overview) tokens that power the components
- [Radix Primitives](/primitives), a library of accessible, unstyled components
- [Radix Colors](/colors), a color system for building beautiful websites and apps

Feel free to explore the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/tree/main/packages/radix-ui-themes) of Radix Themes to see how it is built.

## Common issues

### z-index conflicts

Out of the box, portalled Radix Themes components can be nested and stacked in any order without conflicts. For example, you can open a popover that opens a dialog, which in turn opens another popover. They all stack on top of each other in the order they were opened:

When building your own components, use the following rules to avoid z-index conflicts:

- Don’t use `z-index` values other than `auto`, `0`, or `-1` in rare cases.
- Render the elements that should stack on top of each other in portals.

Your main content and portalled content are separated by the stacking context that the styles of the root `<Theme>` component create. This allows you to stack portalled content on top of the main content without worrying about z-indices.

### Next.js import order

As of Next.js 13.0 to 14.1, the import order of CSS files in `app/**/layout.tsx` is not guaranteed, so Radix Themes may overwrite your own styles even when written correctly:

```js
import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
import "./my-styles.css";
```

This Next.js issue may come and go sporadically, or happen only in development or production.

As a workaround, you can merge all the CSS into a single file first via [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) and import just that into your layout. Alternatively, importing the styles directly in `page.tsx` files also works.

### Tailwind base styles

As of Tailwind v3, styles produced by the `@tailwind` directive are usually appended after any imported CSS, no matter the original import order. In particular, Tailwind’s [button reset](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/7361468f77500105b0559e879e121f34306e8da2/src/css/preflight.css#L197-L204) style may interfere with Radix Themes buttons, rendering certain buttons without a background color.

Workarounds:

- Don’t use `@tailwind base`
- Set up separate CSS [layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) for Tailwind and Radix Themes
- Set up [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) and manually import Tailwind base styles via `@import tailwindcss/base` before Radix Themes styles. [Example setup](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/issues/109#issuecomment-1747345743)

### Missing styles in portals

When you render a custom portal in a Radix Themes project, it will naturally appear outside of the root `<Theme>` component, which means it won’t have access to most of the theme tokens and styles. To fix that, wrap the portal content with another `<Theme>`:

```jsx line=11,18
// Implementation example of a custom dialog using the low-level Dialog primitive
// Refer to https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";
import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";

function MyCustomDialog() {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Theme>
					<Dialog.Overlay />
					<Dialog.Content>
						<Dialog.Title />
						<Dialog.Description />
						<Dialog.Close />
					</Dialog.Content>
				</Theme>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
}
```

Components like Dialog and Popover in Radix Themes already handle this for you, so this is only necessary when creating your own portalled components.

### Complex CSS precedence

Usually, you’d want your custom CSS to override Radix Themes styles. However, there are cases when it is natural to expect the opposite.

Consider a simple paragraph style that just resets the browser’s default margin:

```css
.my-paragraph {
	margin: 0;
}
```

You might apply the margin prop from a `Box` onto your custom paragraph via `asChild`:

```jsx line="7,9"
import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
import "./my-styles.css";

function MyApp() {
	return (
		<Theme>
			<Box asChild m="5">
				<p className="my-paragraph">My custom paragraph</p>
			</Box>
		</Theme>
	);
}
```

Yet, this won’t work intuitively. The custom styles are imported after Radix Themes styles, so they will override the margin prop. As a workaround, Radix Themes provides separate `tokens.css`, `components.css`, and `utilities.css` files that the original `styles.css` is built upon:

```jsx
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/components.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/utilities.css";
```

You can import `utilities.css` after your custom styles to ensure that the layout props work as expected with your custom styles. However, if you use Next.js, keep in mind the [import order issue](#nextjs-import-order) that’s mentioned above.

If you use [standalone layout components](/themes/docs/overview/layout#standalone-usage), split CSS files are also available for them:

```jsx
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout/tokens.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout/components.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout/utilities.css";
```

# Theme Configuration

## Breakpoints

Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adapative layouts.

# Breakpoints

Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adaptive layouts.

## Available sizes

Each breakpoint matches a fixed screen width. Values are `min-width` based and apply when the screen width is equal or greater.

## Usage

Most component size and layout props will accept an additional `Responsive` object shape for modifying the given prop across breakpoints.

Each size maps to a corresponding key, the value of each will be applied when the screen size is greater than or equal to the named breakpoint.

```jsx
<Heading
	size={{
		initial: "3",
		md: "5",
		xl: "7",
	}}
/>
```

## Color

Understanding the color system and it’s application in your theme.

# Color

Understanding the color system and its application in your theme.

Radix Themes comes with a number of color scales, each with their own light, dark and alpha variants. Under the hood, the color system is powered by [Radix Colors](/colors).

## Accents

Accent color is the most dominant color in your theme. It is used for primary buttons, links and other interactive elements. `accentColor` is specified directly on the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) component:

```jsx
<Theme accentColor="indigo">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

#### Available accent colors

There is a range of accent colors to choose from:

#### Accent scale anatomy

Each accent is a 12-step scale that includes a solid and a transparent variant of each color. For example, here’s the `indigo` color scale:

#### Accent scale tokens

Accent color tokens can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are accessible and consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Backgrounds */
var(--accent-1);
var(--accent-2);

/* Interactive components */
var(--accent-3);
var(--accent-4);
var(--accent-5);

/* Borders and separators */
var(--accent-6);
var(--accent-7);
var(--accent-8);

/* Solid colors */
var(--accent-9);
var(--accent-10);

/* Accessible text */
var(--accent-11);
var(--accent-12);

/* Functional colors */
var(--accent-surface);
var(--accent-indicator);
var(--accent-track);
var(--accent-contrast);
```

***

## Grays

You can also choose between a pure gray or a number of tinted grays. Your accent color will be automatically paired with a gray shade that compliments it. However, you can also specify a custom `grayColor` directly on the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) component:

```jsx
<Theme grayColor="mauve">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

#### Available gray colors

There is 6 grays to choose from. The difference may seem subtle, but it is impactful especially on pages with a lot of text or in dense UIs.

#### Gray scale anatomy

Grays are based on the same 12-step color scale that includes a solid and a transparent variant of each color. For example, here’s the `slate` color scale:

#### Gray scale tokens

Gray color tokens can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are accessible and consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Backgrounds */
var(--gray-1);
var(--gray-2);

/* Interactive components */
var(--gray-3);
var(--gray-4);
var(--gray-5);

/* Borders and separators */
var(--gray-6);
var(--gray-7);
var(--gray-8);

/* Solid colors */
var(--gray-9);
var(--gray-10);

/* Accessible text */
var(--gray-11);
var(--gray-12);

/* Functional colors */
var(--gray-surface);
var(--gray-indicator);
var(--gray-track);
var(--gray-contrast);
```

***

## Color overrides

When available, the `color` prop on the components can be used to override the theme accent.
Nested components will automatically inherit the new accent color.

```jsx live=true line=17
<Theme accentColor="indigo">
	<Flex align="start" direction={{ initial: "column", sm: "row" }} gap="4">
		<Callout.Root>
			<Callout.Icon>
				<InfoCircledIcon />
			</Callout.Icon>
			<Callout.Text>
				<Flex as="span" align="center" gap="4">
					<Text>There are new commits.</Text>
					<Button variant="surface" size="1" my="-2">
						Refresh
					</Button>
				</Flex>
			</Callout.Text>
		</Callout.Root>

		<Callout.Root color="gray">
			<Callout.Icon>
				<InfoCircledIcon />
			</Callout.Icon>
			<Callout.Text>
				<Flex as="span" align="center" gap="4">
					<Text>There are new commits.</Text>
					<Button variant="surface" size="1" my="-2">
						Refresh
					</Button>
				</Flex>
			</Callout.Text>
		</Callout.Root>
	</Flex>
</Theme>
```

#### Individual color tokens

Individual colors can be accessed directly using similar CSS variables by their corresponding names. For example, the reds are accessed via `--red-1`, `--red-2`, and so on up to `--red-12`.

***

## High contrast

Most of the time, components with a `color` prop also provide a `highContrast` option that achieves appearance that stands out against the page background:

```jsx live=true line="5"
<Flex gap="4">
	<Button variant="classic" color="gray">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button variant="classic" color="gray" highContrast>
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

***

## Focus and selection

Radix Themes automatically adjusts the focus and selection colors depending on the accent color of the current component. Most of the time, setting the `color` prop will intelligently change the focus and selection colors to avoid a mismatch of conflicting hues:

```jsx live=true line="1,6,9"
<Theme accentColor="indigo">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
		<Text>
			Complete your account setup in <Link href="#">settings</Link>
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray">
			Complete your account setup in <Link href="#">settings</Link>
		</Text>
		<Text color="red">
			Complete your account setup in <Link href="#">settings</Link>
		</Text>
	</Flex>
</Theme>
```

#### Focus scale tokens

Focus color tokens can be accessed using CSS variables that follow a similar naming structure like the other scales, e.g. `--focus-1`, `--focus-2`, and so on up to `--focus-12`.

Most of the components use `--focus-8` for the focus outline color.

***

## Alpha colors

Every color has an alpha variant which is designed to appear visually the same when placed over the page background. This is a powerful tool that allows colors to look naturally when overlayed over another background. All numerical color steps have a corresponding alpha variant.

```css
/* Solid colors */
var(--red-1);
var(--red-2);
...
var(--red-12);

/* Alpha colors */
var(--red-a1);
var(--red-a2);
...
var(--red-a12);
```

Alpha colors are used automatically within Radix Themes components—no additional configuration is required.

***

## Backgrounds

A number of background colors are used to create a sense of visual hierarchy in Radix Themes UIs. These colors are used for backgrounds, cards, and other surfaces.

```css
/* Page background */
var(--color-background);

/* Panel backgrounds, such as cards, tables, popovers, dropdown menus, etc. */
var(--color-panel-solid);
var(--color-panel-translucent);

/* Form component backgrounds, such as text fields, checkboxes, select, etc. */
var(--color-surface);

/* Dialog overlays */
var(--color-overlay);
```

### Panel background

The `panelBackground` prop controls whether panelled elements use a solid or a translucent background color. The default `translucent` value creates a subtle overlay effect:

```jsx
<Theme panelBackground="translucent">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

While `solid` is useful when you'd prefer to present information unobstructed.

```jsx
<Theme panelBackground="solid">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

***

## Customization

Radix Themes colors can be customized by overriding the corresponding CSS variables of the token system. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/color.css) for the full list of the color tokens.

Make sure that your CSS is applied after the Radix Themes styles so that it takes precedence.

### Brand color

You can replace a specific color with your brand color by remapping the corresponding token. Usually, you’d override **step 9** of the scale that you are using as your theme accent.

```css
.radix-themes {
	--my-brand-color: #3052f6;
	--indigo-9: var(--my-brand-color);
	--indigo-a9: var(--my-brand-color);
}
```

In this example, using solid-colored `indigo` components will now reference your custom color.

### Custom palette

You can use the [custom color palette tool](/colors/custom) to generate a custom palette based just on a couple reference colors. Once you are happy with the result, paste the generated CSS into your project. You can rename the generated colors to match the accent that you want to use in your theme.

To generate dark theme colors, toggle the appearance to use the dark theme. Make sure to paste the generated CSS after your light theme color overrides.

### Color aliasing

You may prefer to use generic color names to refer to the color shades that you want to use. For example, it is common to refer to `crimson`, `jade`, and `indigo` as `red`, `green`, and `blue` respectively.

In this case, you can remap Radix Themes tokens in place of one another and reclaim the color names you want to use:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--red-1: var(--ruby-1);
	--red-2: var(--ruby-2);
	--red-3: var(--ruby-3);
	--red-4: var(--ruby-4);
	--red-5: var(--ruby-5);
	--red-6: var(--ruby-6);
	--red-7: var(--ruby-7);
	--red-8: var(--ruby-8);
	--red-9: var(--ruby-9);
	--red-10: var(--ruby-10);
	--red-11: var(--ruby-11);
	--red-12: var(--ruby-12);

	--red-a1: var(--ruby-a1);
	--red-a2: var(--ruby-a2);
	--red-a3: var(--ruby-a3);
	--red-a4: var(--ruby-a4);
	--red-a5: var(--ruby-a5);
	--red-a6: var(--ruby-a6);
	--red-a7: var(--ruby-a7);
	--red-a8: var(--ruby-a8);
	--red-a9: var(--ruby-a9);
	--red-a10: var(--ruby-a10);
	--red-a11: var(--ruby-a11);
	--red-a12: var(--ruby-a12);

	--red-surface: var(--ruby-surface);
	--red-indicator: var(--ruby-indicator);
	--red-track: var(--ruby-track);
	--red-contrast: var(--ruby-contrast);
}
```

In this example, using the `red` color in Radix Themes components and tokens would now reference the original `ruby` scale.

***

## Individual CSS files

Color definitions comprise around 20% of the total CSS size that Radix Themes ships with.

If you’d prefer to reduce your CSS bundle size and have access just to the colors you use, you can import the individual CSS files for each color module. Here’s a sample setup:

```ts
// Base theme tokens
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/base.css";

// Include just the colors you use, for example `ruby`, `teal`, and `slate`.
// Remember to import the gray tint that matches your theme setting.
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/colors/ruby.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/colors/teal.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/colors/slate.css";

// Rest of the CSS
import "@radix-ui/themes/components.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/utilities.css";
```

Please note that the colors you didn’t import will still be accepted by the `color` prop in React. Also, make sure that your developer tooling [preserves](/themes/docs/overview/styling#nextjs-import-order) the order of the imported CSS files.

## Cursors

Customizing cursors used for interactive elements.

# Cursors

Customizing cursors used for interactive elements.

## Default cursors

By default, interactive elements that don’t link to another page use the regular arrow cursor. This also matches the browser defaults. However, disabled elements use an explicit disabled cursor.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4" wrap="wrap">
	<Flex align="center" gap="3" wrap="wrap">
		<Button>Button</Button>
		<Button asChild>
			<a href="#">Link</a>
		</Button>
		<Button disabled>Disabled</Button>
	</Flex>
	<Button variant="ghost">Ghost button</Button>
	<Link href="#" size="2">
		Link
	</Link>
	<Checkbox defaultChecked />
	<Switch defaultChecked />
	<Switch defaultChecked disabled />
</Flex>
```

## Cursor tokens

Cursor settings can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are accessible and consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Available cursor tokens */
var(--cursor-button);
var(--cursor-checkbox);
var(--cursor-disabled);
var(--cursor-link);
var(--cursor-menu-item);
var(--cursor-radio);
var(--cursor-slider-thumb);
var(--cursor-slider-thumb-active);
var(--cursor-switch);
```

## Customization

It’s common to use a pointer cursor for interactive elements. Radix Themes cursors can be customized by overriding the corresponding CSS variables of the token system.

Here’s an example of how you can customize the cursor tokens to set `cursor: pointer` for most interactive elements in the theme:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--cursor-button: pointer;
	--cursor-checkbox: pointer;
	--cursor-disabled: default;
	--cursor-link: pointer;
	--cursor-menu-item: pointer;
	--cursor-radio: pointer;
	--cursor-slider-thumb: grab;
	--cursor-slider-thumb-active: grabbing;
	--cursor-switch: pointer;
}
```

Make sure that your CSS is applied after the Radix Themes styles so that it takes precedence.

## Dark mode

Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.

# Dark mode

Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.

## Overview

Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or styling.

## Basic usage

By default, the root `Theme` appearance is `light`. To set a different appearance pass it via the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

```jsx line=1
<Theme appearance="dark">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

## Inheriting system appearance

A common requirement is to inherit the appearance setting from a user’s system preferences.

This is a deceptively complex problem to solve given SSR, SSG and client side hydration considerations. To make implementation easier, we recommend integrating with a theme switching library.

### With next-themes

Integration with `next-themes` is simple and straightforward because Radix Themes implements matching class names.

To enable dark mode, use `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`.

```jsx line=6
import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function () {
	return (
		<ThemeProvider attribute="class">
			<Theme>
				<MyApp />
			</Theme>
		</ThemeProvider>
	);
}
```

### With other libraries

Any library that supports class switching is compatible. You’ll just need to ensure that the appended class names match those supported by Radix Themes:

- `className="light"`
- `className="light-theme"`
- `className="dark"`
- `className="dark-theme"`

## Theme overview

Use the Theme component to change the look and feel of your UI.

# Theme overview

Use the Theme component to change the look and feel of your UI.

## Anatomy

The [Theme component](/themes/docs/components/theme) defines the overall visual look of your application. It can be customized by passing a minimal set of configuration options.

```jsx live=true
<Theme
	accentColor="mint"
	grayColor="gray"
	panelBackground="solid"
	scaling="100%"
	radius="full"
>
	<ThemesVolumeControlExample />
</Theme>
```

A well tuned set of defaults is provided to get you started, but don’t be afraid to play with all of the available options to find the right visual style for your application. Check out the [Playground](/themes/playground) to see what effect each option has.

## Variants

Variants are visual variations of a component which are used to create visual hierarchies and communicate relative importance.

Each component offers a different set of variants, though all are designed to be consistent and complimentary with each other.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Button variant="classic">
		Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
	</Button>
	<Button variant="solid">
		Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
	</Button>
	<Button variant="soft">
		Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

## Examples

Using a combination of component variants alongside customized theme settings allows you to create a multitude of unique-looking interfaces.

For example you could create:

- [Music applications](/themes/example-music-app)
- [Ecommerce product elements](/themes/example-ecommerce)
- [SaaS dashboards](/themes/example-dashboard)

Or any number of differing treatments and styles.

## Tokens

Tokens provide direct access to theme values and give you flexibility to build and customize your own themed components.

For all available theme tokens see the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/tree/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens), or read more about each type of token in the relevant theme pages.

## Radius

Choosing the right radius setting in your theme.

# Radius

Choosing the right radius setting in your theme.

## Theme setting

Theme `radius` setting manages the radius factor applied to the components:

```jsx line="1"
<Theme radius="medium">
	<TextField.Root size="3" placeholder="Reply…">
		<TextField.Slot side="right" px="1">
			<Button size="2">Send</Button>
		</TextField.Slot>
	</TextField.Root>
</Theme>
```

The resulting `border-radius` is contextual and differs depending on the component. For example, when set to `full`, a [Button](/themes/docs/components/button) becomes pill-shaped, while a [Checkbox](/themes/docs/components/checkbox) will never become fully rounded to prevent any confusion between it and a [Radio](/themes/docs/components/radio).

```jsx live=true
<Theme radius="full">
	<Flex align="center" gap="3">
		<Button>Save</Button>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
		<Checkbox defaultChecked />
	</Flex>
</Theme>
```

## Radius overrides

Certain components allow you to override the radius factor using their own `radius` prop.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="3">
	<Button radius="none">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="small">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="medium">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="large">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="full">Save</Button>
</Flex>
```

Components that render panels, like Card, Dialog, and Popover, among others, won’t have the `radius` prop, but will inherit the radius setting from the theme. The `radius` prop is also unavailable on most text-based components.

## Radius scale

Radius values used in the components are derived from a 6-step scale.

While you can’t use a specific step on a particular component directly—the `radius` prop is used to set just the radius factor—you can use the radius scale to style your own components.

Radius tokens are accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Radius values that automatically respond to the radius factor */
var(--radius-1);
var(--radius-2);
var(--radius-3);
var(--radius-4);
var(--radius-5);
var(--radius-6);

/* A multiplier that controls the theme radius */
var(--radius-factor);

/*
 * A variable used to calculate a fully rounded radius.
 * Usually used within a CSS `max()` function.
 */
var(--radius-full);

/*
 * A variable used to calculate radius of a thumb element.
 * Usually used within a CSS `max()` function.
 */
var(--radius-thumb);
```

## Shadows

Understanding the shadow styles used in your theme.

# Shadows

Understanding the shadow styles used in your theme.

Shadows used in the components are derived from a 6-step scale. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/shadow.css) for the actual values used to achieve these shadows.

#### Shadow tokens

Shadow tokens can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Inset shadow */
var(--shadow-1);

/* Shadows for variant="classic" panels, like Card */
var(--shadow-2);
var(--shadow-3);

/* Shadows for smaller overlay panels, like Hover Card and Popover */
var(--shadow-4);
var(--shadow-5);

/* Shadows for larger overlay panels, like Dialog */
var(--shadow-6);
```

## Spacing

Overview of the space scale and scaling options.

# Spacing

Overview of the space scale and scaling options.

## Space scale

Spacing values are derived from a 9-step scale, which is used for props such as margin and padding. These props accept numeric strings from `"1"` to `"9"`, which correspond to the steps in the scale below.

#### Space scale tokens

Space scale tokens can be also accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Space scale */
var(--space-1);
var(--space-2);
var(--space-3);
var(--space-4);
var(--space-5);
var(--space-6);
var(--space-7);
var(--space-8);
var(--space-9);
```

## Scaling

Values which affect layout (spacing, font size, line height) scale relatively to each other based on the `scaling` value defined in your Theme. This setting allows you to scale the UI density uniformly across your entire application.

```jsx line="1"
<Theme scaling="100%">
	<Card variant="surface">
		<Flex gap="3" align="center">
			<Avatar size="3" src={person.image} fallback={person.name} />
			<Box>
				<Text as="div" size="2" weight="bold">
					{person.name}
				</Text>
				<Text as="div" size="2" color="gray">
					Approved invoice <Link>#3461</Link>
				</Text>
			</Box>
		</Flex>
	</Card>
</Theme>
```

#### Scaling factor

The scaling factor token can be accessed using the `--scaling` CSS variable. If you need to use different scaling factors in your app, you can use this token in your custom styles, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
.MyCustomComponent {
	width: calc(200px * var(--scaling));
}
```

## Typography

Guidance for using and tuning typography.

# Typography

Guidance for using and tuning typography.

## Base components

Use [Text](/themes/docs/components/text) and [Heading](/themes/docs/components/heading) components to render titles and body copy. These components share `size` and `weight` props and map to the underlying type system to ensure consistent typography throughout your app.

```jsx live=true
<Heading mb="2" size="4">Typographic principles</Heading>
<Text>The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.</Text>
```

## Formatting components

Compose formatting components to add [emphasis](/themes/docs/components/em), [signal importance](/themes/docs/components/strong), present [code](/themes/docs/components/code) and more.

```jsx live=true
<Text>
	The <Em>most</Em> important thing to remember is,{" "}
	<Strong>stay positive</Strong>.
</Text>
```

## Type scale

The typographic system is based on a 9-step `size` scale. Every step has a corresponding font size, line height and letter spacing value which are all designed to be used in combination.

```jsx live="true"
<Text size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
```

## Font weight

The following weights are supported. Weights can be [customized](/themes/docs/theme/typography#custom-font-weights) to map to your own typeface.

```jsx live="true"
<Text size="6">
	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text weight="light">Light</Text>
		<Text weight="regular">Regular</Text>
		<Text weight="medium">Medium</Text>
		<Text weight="bold">Bold</Text>
	</Flex>
</Text>
```

## Font family

By default, Radix Themes uses a system font stack for portability and legibility. Continue to the next section to learn about customizing your theme with a custom font.

## Customization

Radix Themes typography can be customized by overriding the corresponding CSS variables of the token system. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/typography.css) for the full list of the typographic tokens.

Make sure that your CSS is applied after the Radix Themes styles so that it takes precedence.

### Custom fonts

You can provide your own fonts, however, how you choose to import and serve them is up to you. It is only required that you specify your named fonts using the correct syntax.

To customize the font family used in your theme, remap the corresponding `font-family` tokens:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-font-family:  /* Your custom default font */ --heading-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Heading> components */ --code-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Code> components */ --strong-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Strong> components */ --em-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Em> components */ --quote-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Quote> components */;
}
```

### With next/font

To load custom fonts via [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font), use the [`variable`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#variable) option to define a CSS variable name. Then, add that CSS variable class to your HTML document.

```jsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
	subsets: ["latin"],
	display: "swap",
	variable: "--font-inter",
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
	return (
		<html lang="en" className={inter.variable}>
			<body>{children}</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

Finally, assign the CSS variable in your custom CSS:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-font-family: var(--font-inter);
}
```

Be aware that you may encounter css import order issues if you are running the app router. See [common styling issues](/themes/docs/overview/styling#nextjs-import-order) for more information.

### Custom font weights

To customize the exact font weights used in your theme, remap the corresponding `font-weight` tokens to your own values:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--font-weight-light: 200;
	--font-weight-regular: 300;
	--font-weight-medium: 600;
	--font-weight-bold: 800;
}
```

### Advanced settings

There’s a number of advanced typographic features that can be customized. These include a font size multiplier for certain components, font style, letter spacing, and leading trim. For example, you can customize the headings to render with a relatively larger font size than your default font, different leading trim values, and tighter letter spacing:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--heading-font-family: "Untitled Sans", sans-serif;
	--heading-font-size-adjust: 1.05;
	--heading-font-style: normal;
	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.38em;
	--heading-letter-spacing: -0.01em;
}
```

				<Button variant="solid" color="red">
					Revoke access
				</Button>
			</AlertDialog.Action>
		</Flex>
	</AlertDialog.Content>
</AlertDialog.Root>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits parts and props from the [Alert Dialog primitive](/primitives/docs/components/alert-dialog) and is visually identical to [Dialog](/themes/docs/components/dialog), though with differing semantics and behavior.

### Root

Contains all the parts of the dialog.

### Trigger

Wraps the control that will open the dialog.

### Content

Contains the content of the dialog. This component is based on the `div` element.

### Title

An accessible title that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Heading](/themes/docs/components/heading) component with a pre-defined font size and leading trim on top.

### Description

An optional accessible description that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Text](/themes/docs/components/text) component with a pre-defined font size.

If you want to remove the description entirely, remove this part and pass `aria-describedby={undefined}` to `Content`.

### Action

Wraps the control that will close the dialog. This should be distinguished visually from the `Cancel` control.

### Cancel

Wraps the control that will close the dialog. This should be distinguished visually from the `Action` control.

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control size of the dialog. It will affect the `padding` and `border-radius` of the Content.
Use it in conjunction with the `width`, `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props to control the width of the dialog.

```jsx live=true line=6,17,28,39
<Flex gap="4" align="center">
	<AlertDialog.Root>

				The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
			</Text>
		</AlertDialog.Content>
	</AlertDialog.Root>
</Flex>
```

### With inset content

Use the [Inset](/themes/docs/components/inset) component to align content flush with the sides of the dialog.

```jsx live=true
<AlertDialog.Root>
	<AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<Button color="red">Delete users</Button>
	</AlertDialog.Trigger>
	<AlertDialog.Content maxWidth="500px">
		<AlertDialog.Title>Delete Users</AlertDialog.Title>
		<AlertDialog.Description size="2">
			Are you sure you want to delete these users? This action is permanent and

## Box

Fundamental layout building block.

```jsx live=true
<Box width="64px" height="64px">
	<DecorativeBox />
</Box>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `div` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

Only the `display` prop values are unique to the Box component.

The following props are shared between [Box](./box), [Flex](./flex), [Grid](./grid), [Container](./container) and [Section](./section) components. Read more about layout components in [Layout](/themes/docs/overview/layout).

---

## Button

Trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form or displaying a dialog.

```jsx live=true
<Button>
	<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
</Button>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `button` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the button.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Button size="1" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button size="2" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button size="3" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style of the button.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex align="center" gap="3">
	<Button variant="classic">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="solid">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="soft">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="surface">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="outline">Edit profile</Button>
</Flex>
```

#### Ghost

Use the `ghost` variant to display a button without chrome. Ghost buttons behave like text in layout, as they use a negative margin to optically align themselves against their siblings while maintaining the padding in active and hover states.

```jsx live=true
<Button variant="ghost">Edit profile</Button>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button color="indigo" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button color="cyan" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button color="orange" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button color="crimson" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Flex gap="3">
		<Button color="gray" variant="classic">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="solid">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="soft">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="surface">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="outline">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
	</Flex>
	<Flex gap="3">
		<Button color="gray" variant="classic" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="solid" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="soft" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="surface" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="outline" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
	</Flex>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button radius="none" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button radius="large" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button radius="full" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### With icons

You can nest icons directly inside the button. An appropriate gap is provided automatically.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button variant="classic">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="solid">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="soft">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="surface">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="outline">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### Loading

Use the `loading` prop to display a loading spinner in place of button content, preserving the original size of the button in its normal state. The button will be disabled while loading.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button loading variant="classic">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="solid">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="soft">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="surface">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="outline">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

If you have an icon inside the button, you can use the button’s `disabled` state and wrap the icon in a standalone [Spinner](/themes/docs/components/spinner) to achieve a more sophisticated design.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button disabled variant="classic">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="solid">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="soft">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="surface">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="outline">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="cyan" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="orange" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="crimson" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live=true
<Grid rows="2" gap="2" display="inline-grid" flow="column">
	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="indigo" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="indigo" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="cyan" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="cyan" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="orange" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="orange" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="crimson" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="crimson" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="gray" defaultValue="1">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root color="gray" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" />
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>
</Grid>
```

### Alignment

Composing `CheckboxGroup.Item` within `Text` automatically centers it with the first line of text.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<CheckboxGroup.Root size="1" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="2">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="2">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root size="2" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="3">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="3">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root size="3" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="4">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="4">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

It is automatically well-aligned with multi-line text too.

### Disabled

Use the native `disabled` attribute to create a disabled checkbox.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
	<CheckboxGroup.Root defaultValue="2">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1">Off</CheckboxGroup.Item>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2">On</CheckboxGroup.Item>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root defaultValue="2">
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" disabled>
			Off
		</CheckboxGroup.Item>
		<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" disabled>
			On
		</CheckboxGroup.Item>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the [Dialog primitive](/primitives/docs/components/dialog).

### Root

Contains all the parts of a dialog.

### Trigger

Wraps the control that will open the dialog.

### Content

Contains the content of the dialog. This component is based on the `div` element.

### Title

An accessible title that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Heading](/themes/docs/components/heading) component with a pre-defined font size and leading trim on top.

### Description

An optional accessible description that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Text](/themes/docs/components/text) component with a pre-defined font size.

If you want to remove the description entirely, remove this part and pass `aria-describedby={undefined}` to `Content`.

### Close

Wraps the control that will close the dialog.

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control size of the dialog. It will affect the `padding` and `border-radius` of the Content.
Use it in conjunction with the `width`, `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props to control the width of the dialog.

```jsx live=true line=6,17,28,39
<Flex gap="4" align="center">
	<Dialog.Root>

			</Text>
		</Dialog.Content>
	</Dialog.Root>
</Flex>
```

### With inset content

Use the [Inset](/themes/docs/components/inset) component to align content flush with the sides of the dialog.

```jsx live=true
<Dialog.Root>
	<Dialog.Trigger>
		<Button>View users</Button>
	</Dialog.Trigger>
	<Dialog.Content>
		<Dialog.Title>Users</Dialog.Title>

	<Box width="64px" height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
	<Box width="64px" height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
	<Box width="64px" height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
	<Box width="64px" height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `div` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

Use these props to create flex layouts.

The following props are shared between [Box](./box), [Flex](./flex), [Grid](./grid), [Container](./container) and [Section](./section) components. Read more about layout components in [Layout](/themes/docs/overview/layout).

---

	<DecorativeBox />
	<DecorativeBox />
	<DecorativeBox />
	<DecorativeBox />
	<DecorativeBox />
	<DecorativeBox />
</Grid>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `div` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

Use these props to create grid layouts.

The following props are shared between [Box](./box), [Flex](./flex), [Grid](./grid), [Container](./container) and [Section](./section) components. Read more about layout components in [Layout](/themes/docs/overview/layout).

## Examples

### Responsive

All props marked `Responsive`, such as `columns` and `rows` accept a [breakpoint object](/themes/docs/theme/breakpoints). For example, the following grid starts with 1 column, and uses 2 columns from the medium breakpoint.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns={{ initial: "1", md: "2" }} gap="3" width="auto">
	<Box height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
	<Box height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
</Grid>
```

---

## Heading

Semantic heading element.

```jsx live=true
<Heading>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `h1` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### As another element

Use the `as` prop to change the heading level. This prop is purely semantic and does not change the visual appearance.

```jsx live=true
<Heading as="h1">Level 1</Heading>
<Heading as="h2">Level 2</Heading>
<Heading as="h3">Level 3</Heading>
```

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the heading. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Heading size="1">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="2">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="3">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="4">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="5">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="7">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="8">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="9">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Heading weight="regular">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Heading>

<Heading weight="medium">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Heading>

<Heading weight="bold">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Heading>
```

### Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```jsx live=true
<Heading align="left">Left-aligned</Heading>
<Heading align="center">Center-aligned</Heading>
<Heading align="right">Right-aligned</Heading>
```

### Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.

The prop works similarly to the upcoming [half-leading control](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#leading-trim) spec, but uses a common [negative margin workaround](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) under the hood for cross-browser support.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Heading
		trim="normal"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		Without trim
	</Heading>
	<Heading
		trim="both"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		With trim
	</Heading>
</Flex>
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Box
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
		p="4"
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3">
			Without trim
		</Heading>
		<Text>
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>

	<Box
		p="4"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3" trim="start">
			With trim
		</Heading>
		<Text trim="end">
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

The default trim values are configured for the system font stack that’s used by Radix Themes. If you are using custom fonts, you can [adjust](/themes/docs/theme/typography#customization) the trim values using the corresponding CSS variables.

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--default-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
}
```

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading truncate>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### Wrap

Use the `wrap` prop to control text wrapping.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading wrap="nowrap">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading wrap="balance">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading wrap="pretty">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color). The text colors are designed to achieve at least Lc 60 APCA contrast over common background colors.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column">
	<Heading color="indigo">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading color="cyan">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading color="orange">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading color="crimson">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column">
	<Heading color="gray">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Heading>
	<Heading color="gray" highContrast>
		The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	</Heading>
</Flex>
```

## Icon Button

Button designed specifically for usage with a single icon.

```jsx live=true
<IconButton>
	<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
</IconButton>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `button` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the button.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="3">
	<IconButton size="1" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="15" height="15" />
	</IconButton>

	<IconButton size="2" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>

	<IconButton size="3" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="22" height="22" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style of the button.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<IconButton variant="classic">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton variant="solid">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton variant="surface">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton variant="outline">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

#### Ghost

Use the `ghost` variant to display a button without chrome. Ghost buttons behave like text in layout, as they use a negative margin to optically align themselves against their siblings while maintaining the padding in active and hover states.

```jsx live=true
<IconButton variant="ghost">
	<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
</IconButton>
```

### Color

	</IconButton>
	<IconButton color="indigo" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton color="grass" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton color="orange" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

		</IconButton>
		<IconButton color="gray" variant="solid">
			<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
		</IconButton>
		<IconButton color="gray" variant="soft">
			<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
		</IconButton>
		<IconButton color="gray" variant="surface">

		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton radius="full" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

### Loading

Use the `loading` prop to display a loading spinner in place of button content. The button will be disabled while loading.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<IconButton loading variant="classic">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton loading variant="solid">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={25} size="1" />
	<Progress value={50} size="2" />
	<Progress value={75} size="3" />
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={25} variant="classic" />
	<Progress value={50} variant="surface" />
	<Progress value={75} variant="soft" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={20} color="indigo" />
	<Progress value={40} color="cyan" />
	<Progress value={60} color="orange" />
	<Progress value={80} color="crimson" />
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns="2" gap="4">
	<Progress value={10} color="indigo" />
	<Progress value={10} color="indigo" highContrast />
	<Progress value={30} color="cyan" />
	<Progress value={30} color="cyan" highContrast />
	<Progress value={50} color="orange" />
	<Progress value={50} color="orange" highContrast />
	<Progress value={70} color="crimson" />
	<Progress value={70} color="crimson" highContrast />
	<Progress value={90} color="gray" />
	<Progress value={90} color="gray" highContrast />
</Grid>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true

Use the `value` prop to provide a precise indication of the task progress.

```jsx live=true
<Progress value={75} />
```

### With custom duration

Use the `duration` prop to indicate an approximate duration of an indeterminate task. Once the duration times out, the progress bar will start an indeterminate animation.

```jsx live=true
<Progress duration="30s" />
```

When an approximate duration can be estimated, the Progress component is still useful over [Spinner](./spinner), which doesn’t provide any visual cues towards the progress of the task.

## Radio Group

Set of interactive radio buttons where only one can be selected at a time.

```jsx live=true
<RadioGroup.Root defaultValue="1" name="example">
	<RadioGroup.Item value="1">Default</RadioGroup.Item>
	<RadioGroup.Item value="2">Comfortable</RadioGroup.Item>
	<RadioGroup.Item value="3">Compact</RadioGroup.Item>
</RadioGroup.Root>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the [Radio Group primitive](/primitives/docs/components/radio-group) and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

### Root

Contains all the parts of a radio group.

### Item

An item in the group that can be checked.

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the radiobutton size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="2">
	<RadioGroup.Root size="1" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root size="2" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root size="3" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style of the radio buttons.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="2">
	<Flex direction="column" asChild gap="2">
		<RadioGroup.Root variant="surface" defaultValue="1">
			<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
			<RadioGroup.Item value="2" />
		</RadioGroup.Root>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column" asChild gap="2">
		<RadioGroup.Root variant="classic" defaultValue="1">
			<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
			<RadioGroup.Item value="2" />
		</RadioGroup.Root>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column" asChild gap="2">
		<RadioGroup.Root variant="soft" defaultValue="1">
			<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
			<RadioGroup.Item value="2" />
		</RadioGroup.Root>
	</Flex>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="2">
	<RadioGroup.Root color="indigo" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="cyan" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="orange" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="crimson" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live=true
<Grid rows="2" gap="2" display="inline-grid" flow="column">
	<RadioGroup.Root color="indigo" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="indigo" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="cyan" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="cyan" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="orange" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="orange" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="crimson" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="crimson" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="gray" defaultValue="1">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root color="gray" defaultValue="1" highContrast>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" />
	</RadioGroup.Root>
</Grid>
```

### Alignment

Composing `RadioGroup.Item` within `Text` automatically centers it with the first line of text.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<RadioGroup.Root size="1" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="2">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<RadioGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="2">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<RadioGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root size="2" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="3">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<RadioGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="3">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<RadioGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root size="3" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="4">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<RadioGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="4">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<RadioGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</RadioGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

It is automatically well-aligned with multi-line text too.

### Disabled

Use the native `disabled` attribute to create a disabled radiobutton.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
	<RadioGroup.Root defaultValue="2">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1">Off</RadioGroup.Item>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="2">On</RadioGroup.Item>
	</RadioGroup.Root>

	<RadioGroup.Root defaultValue="2">
		<RadioGroup.Item value="1" disabled>
			Off
		</RadioGroup.Item>
		<RadioGroup.Item value="2" disabled>
			On
		</RadioGroup.Item>
	</RadioGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

## Reset

Removes default browser styles from any component.

## API Reference

Reset component is used to aggressively reset browser styles on a specific element.

It renders a [Slot primitive](/primitives/docs/utilities/slot) that:

- Accepts a single React element as its child
- Removes opinionated browser styles
- Sets idiomatic layout defaults, like `display: block` for images or `width: stretch` for inputs
- Sets the [cursor](/themes/docs/theme/cursors) style according to your theme settings
- Adds `box-sizing: border-box`

## Scroll Area

Custom-styled scrollable area using native functionality.

```jsx live=true
<ScrollArea type="always" scrollbars="vertical" style={{ height: 180 }}>
	<Box p="2" pr="8">
		<Heading size="4" mb="2" trim="start">
			Principles of the typographic craft
		</Heading>
		<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
			<Text as="p">
				Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
				aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and “readable”
				are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
				related concepts.
			</Text>

			<Text as="p">
				Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
				distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the
				quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance, if a “b”
				and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to distinguish at small
				sizes, this is a problem of legibility.
			</Text>

			<Text as="p">
				Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to
				select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font
				containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The
				selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using
				only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.
			</Text>
		</Flex>
	</Box>
</ScrollArea>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the ScrollArea primitive [Root](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#root) and [Viewport](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#viewport) parts. It supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the scrollbar handles.

```jsx live=true

	</Select.Content>
</Select.Root>
```

## API Reference

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Select.Root size="1" defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root size="2" defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root size="3" defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop on `Trigger` and `Content` to customize the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="surface" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">

			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

#### Ghost

Use the `ghost` trigger variant to render the trigger without a visually containing element. Ghost triggers behave differently in layout as they use a negative margin to optically align themselves against their siblings while maintaining their padded active and hover states.

```jsx live=true line=11
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="surface" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="ghost" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop on `Trigger` and `Content` to assign a specific color value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="indigo" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="indigo">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="cyan" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="cyan">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="orange" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="orange">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="crimson" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="crimson">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop on `Content` to increase item contrast.

```jsx live=true line=12
<Flex gap="3">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="gray" />
		<Select.Content color="gray" variant="solid">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="gray" />
		<Select.Content color="gray" variant="solid" highContrast>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger radius="none" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger radius="large" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger radius="full" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Placeholder

Use the `placeholder` prop to create a `Trigger` that doesn’t need an initial value.

```jsx live="true"
<Select.Root>
	<Select.Trigger placeholder="Pick a fruit" />
	<Select.Content>
		<Select.Group>
			<Select.Label>Fruits</Select.Label>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="grape" disabled>
				Grape
			</Select.Item>
		</Select.Group>
		<Select.Separator />
		<Select.Group>
			<Select.Label>Vegetables</Select.Label>
			<Select.Item value="carrot">Carrot</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="potato">Potato</Select.Item>
		</Select.Group>
	</Select.Content>
</Select.Root>
```

### Position

Set `position="popper"` prop to position the select menu below the trigger.

```jsx live=true
<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
	<Select.Trigger />
	<Select.Content position="popper">
		<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
		<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
	</Select.Content>
</Select.Root>
```

### With SSR

When using server-side rendering, you might notice a layout shift after hydration. This is because Trigger executes client-side code to display the selected item’s text. To avoid that layout shift, you can render it manually by mapping values.

```jsx live=true
() => {
	const data = {
		apple: "Apple",
		orange: "Orange",
	};
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("apple");
	return (
		<Select.Root value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
			<Select.Trigger>{data[value]}</Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Root>
	);
};
```

### With an icon

You can customise how Trigger renders the value by controlling its children manually. For example, you can render an icon next to the selected item’s text.

```jsx live=true
() => {
	const data = {
		light: { label: "Light", icon: <SunIcon /> },
		dark: { label: "Dark", icon: <MoonIcon /> },
	};
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("light");
	return (
		<Flex direction="column" maxWidth="160px">
			<Select.Root value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
				<Select.Trigger>
					<Flex as="span" align="center" gap="2">
						{data[value].icon}
						{data[value].label}
					</Flex>
				</Select.Trigger>
				<Select.Content position="popper">
					<Select.Item value="light">Light</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item value="dark">Dark</Select.Item>
				</Select.Content>
			</Select.Root>
		</Flex>
	);
};
```

---

## Separator

Visually or semantically separates content.

```jsx live=true
<Text size="2">
	Tools for building high-quality, accessible UI.
	<Separator my="3" size="4" />
	<Flex gap="3" align="center">
		Themes
		<Separator orientation="vertical" />
		Primitives
		<Separator orientation="vertical" />
		Icons
		<Separator orientation="vertical" />
		Colors
	</Flex>
</Text>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the [Separator primitive](/primitives/docs/components/separator) and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the separator. The largest step takes full width or height of the container.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="1" />
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="2" />
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="3" />
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="4" />
</Flex>
```

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4" height="96px">
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="1" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="2" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="3" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="4" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Separator color="indigo" size="4" />
	<Separator color="cyan" size="4" />
	<Separator color="orange" size="4" />
	<Separator color="crimson" size="4" />
</Flex>
```

### Orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to control whether the separator is horizontal or vertical.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4">
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" />
</Flex>
```

---

## Skeleton

Replaces content with same shape placeholder that indicates a loading state.

```jsx live="true"
<Skeleton>Loading</Skeleton>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `span` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the width and height props to manually control the size of the skeleton.

```jsx live="true"
<Skeleton width="48px" height="48px" />
```

### With children

Use the `loading` prop to control whether the skeleton or its children are displayed. Skeleton preserves the dimensions of children when they are hidden and disables interactive elements.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex gap="4">
	<Skeleton loading={true}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Skeleton>

	<Skeleton loading={false}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Skeleton>
</Flex>
```

### With text

When using Skeleton with text, you’d usually wrap the text node itself rather than the parent element. This ensures that the text is replaced with a placeholder of the same size:

```jsx live="true" line="4,7,9"
<Container size="1">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
		<Text>
			<Skeleton>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</Skeleton>
		</Text>

		<Skeleton>
			<Text>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</Text>
		</Skeleton>
	</Flex>
</Container>
```

The difference is especially noticeable when wrapping longer paragraphs:

```jsx live="true" line="4,8,11,17"
<Container size="1">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
		<Text>
			<Skeleton>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque
				felis tellus, efficitur id convallis a, viverra eget libero. Nam magna
				erat, fringilla sed commodo sed, aliquet nec magna.
			</Skeleton>
		</Text>

		<Skeleton>
			<Text>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque
				felis tellus, efficitur id convallis a, viverra eget libero. Nam magna
				erat, fringilla sed commodo sed, aliquet nec magna.
			</Text>
		</Skeleton>
	</Flex>
</Container>
```

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Slider defaultValue={[25]} size="1" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[50]} size="2" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[75]} size="3" />
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Slider defaultValue={[25]} variant="surface" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[50]} variant="classic" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[75]} variant="soft" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Slider defaultValue={[20]} color="indigo" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[40]} color="cyan" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[60]} color="orange" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[80]} color="crimson" />
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast in light mode.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns="2" gap="4">
	<Slider defaultValue={[10]} color="indigo" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[10]} color="indigo" highContrast />
	<Slider defaultValue={[30]} color="cyan" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[30]} color="cyan" highContrast />
	<Slider defaultValue={[50]} color="orange" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[50]} color="orange" highContrast />
	<Slider defaultValue={[70]} color="crimson" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[70]} color="crimson" highContrast />
	<Slider defaultValue={[90]} color="gray" />
	<Slider defaultValue={[90]} color="gray" highContrast />
</Grid>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">

---

## Spinner

Displays an animated loading indicator.

```jsx live="true"
<Spinner />
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `span` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the spinner.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4">
	<Spinner size="1" />
	<Spinner size="2" />
	<Spinner size="3" />
</Flex>
```

### With children

Use the `loading` prop to control whether the spinner or its children are displayed. Spinner preserves the dimensions of children when they are hidden and disables interactive elements.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex gap="4">
	<Spinner loading={true}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Spinner>

	<Spinner loading={false}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Spinner>
</Flex>
```

### With buttons

[Buttons](/themes/docs/components/button) have their own `loading` prop that automatically composes a spinner.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Button loading>Bookmark</Button>
```

If you have an icon inside the button, you can use the button’s `disabled` state and wrap the icon in a standalone `<Spinner>` to achieve a more sophisticated design.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Button disabled>
	<Spinner loading>
		<BookmarkIcon />
	</Spinner>
	Bookmark
</Button>
```

---

## Strong

## Examples

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Strong truncate>
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Strong>
</Flex>
```

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the switch.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="2">
	<Switch size="1" defaultChecked />
	<Switch size="2" defaultChecked />
	<Switch size="3" defaultChecked />
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style of the switch.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="2">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
		<Switch variant="surface" />
		<Switch variant="classic" />
		<Switch variant="soft" />
	</Flex>

	<Switch color="orange" defaultChecked />
	<Switch color="crimson" defaultChecked />
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast in light mode.

```jsx live=true
<Grid rows="2" gapX="2" gapY="3" display="inline-grid" flow="column">
	<Switch color="indigo" defaultChecked />

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
	<Text as="label" size="2">
		<Flex gap="2">
			<Switch size="1" />
			Off
		</Flex>
	</Text>

		<TextField.Root size="2" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	</Box>
	<Box maxWidth="300px">
		<TextField.Root size="3" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

Use matching component sizes when composing Text Field with buttons. However, don’t use size 1 inputs with buttons—at this size, there is not enough vertical space to nest other interactive elements.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="400px">
	<Box maxWidth="200px">
		<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…" size="1">
			<TextField.Slot>
				<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
			</TextField.Slot>
		</TextField.Root>
	</Box>

	<Box maxWidth="250px">
		<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…" size="2">
			<TextField.Slot>
				<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
			</TextField.Slot>
			<TextField.Slot>
				<IconButton size="1" variant="ghost">
					<DotsHorizontalIcon height="14" width="14" />
				</IconButton>
			</TextField.Slot>
		</TextField.Root>
	</Box>

	<Box maxWidth="300px">
		<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…" size="3">
			<TextField.Slot>
				<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
			</TextField.Slot>
			<TextField.Slot pr="3">
				<IconButton size="2" variant="ghost">
					<DotsHorizontalIcon height="16" width="16" />
				</IconButton>
			</TextField.Slot>
		</TextField.Root>
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="250px">
	<TextField.Root variant="surface" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root variant="classic" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root variant="soft" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="250px">
	<TextField.Root
		color="indigo"
		variant="soft"
		placeholder="Search the docs…"
	/>
	<TextField.Root color="green" variant="soft" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root color="red" variant="soft" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="250px">
	<TextField.Root radius="none" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root radius="large" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root radius="full" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

## Text

Foundational text primitive.

```jsx live=true
<Text>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `span` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### As another element

Use the `as` prop to render text as a `p`, `label`, `div` or `span`. This prop is purely semantic and does not alter visual appearance.

```jsx live=true
<Text as="p">This is a <Strong>paragraph</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="label">This is a <Strong>label</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="div">This is a <Strong>div</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="span">This is a <Strong>span</Strong> element.</Text>
```

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Text size="1">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="2">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="3">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="4">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="5">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="7">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="8">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="9">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
</Flex>
```

Sizes 2–4 are designed to work well for long-form content.

```jsx live=true
<Text as="p" mb="5" size="4">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
</Text>

<Text as="p" mb="5" size="3">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
</Text>

<Text as="p" size="2" color="gray">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
</Text>
```

Sizes 1–3 are designed to work well for UI labels.

```jsx live=true
<Grid align="center" columns="2" gap="5" p="3">
	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="3" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="2">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="2" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="2">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="2" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="1">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="1" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="1">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>
</Grid>
```

### Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Text weight="regular" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>

<Text weight="medium" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>

<Text weight="bold" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>
```

### Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```jsx live=true
<Text align="left" as="div">Left-aligned</Text>
<Text align="center" as="div">Center-aligned</Text>
<Text align="right" as="div">Right-aligned</Text>
```

### Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.

The prop works similarly to the upcoming [half-leading control](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#leading-trim) spec, but uses a common [negative margin workaround](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) under the hood for cross-browser support.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Text
		trim="normal"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		Without trim
	</Text>
	<Text
		trim="both"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		With trim
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Box
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
		p="4"
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3">
			Without trim
		</Heading>
		<Text>
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>

	<Box
		p="4"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3" trim="start">
			With trim
		</Heading>
		<Text trim="end">
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

The default trim values are configured for the system font stack that’s used by Radix Themes. If you are using custom fonts, you can [adjust](/themes/docs/theme/typography#customization) the trim values using the corresponding CSS variables.

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--default-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
}
```

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Text truncate>
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

### Wrap

Use the `wrap` prop to control text wrapping.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
	<Text wrap="nowrap">
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
	<Text wrap="balance">
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
	<Text wrap="pretty">
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color). The text colors are designed to achieve at least Lc 60 APCA contrast over common background colors.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column">
	<Text color="indigo">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="cyan">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="orange">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="crimson">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column">
	<Text color="gray">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="gray" highContrast>
		The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

### With formatting

Compose `Text` with formatting components to add emphasis and structure to content.

```jsx live="true"
<Text as="p">
	Look, such a helpful <Link href="#">link</Link>, an <Em>italic emphasis</Em>,
	a piece of computer <Code>code</Code>, and even a hotkey combination{" "}
	<Kbd>⇧⌘A</Kbd> within the text.
</Text>
```

### With form controls

Composing `Text` with a form control like [`Checkbox`](/themes/docs/components/checkbox), [`RadioGroup`](/themes/docs/components/radio-group), or [`Switch`](/themes/docs/components/switch) automatically centers the control with the first line of text, even when the text is multi-line.

```jsx live="true"
<Box maxWidth="300px">
	<Text as="label" size="3">
		<Flex gap="2">
			<Checkbox defaultChecked /> I understand that these documents are
			confidential and cannot be shared with a third party.
		</Flex>
	</Text>
</Box>
```

## Theme

Wraps all or part of a React tree to provide theme configuration.

## API Reference

For an overview of theming see the [overview page](/themes/docs/theme/overview).

## Examples

### Basic configuration

Wrap a component tree in the `Theme` component to provide or modify configuration for all children.

```jsx live=true
<Box maxWidth="400px">
	<Card size="2">
		<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
			<Grid gap="1">
				<Text as="div" weight="bold" size="2" mb="1">
					Feedback
				</Text>
				<TextArea placeholder="Write your feedback…" />
			</Grid>
			<Flex asChild justify="between">
				<label>
					<Text color="gray" size="2">
						Attach screenshot?
					</Text>
					<Switch size="1" defaultChecked />
				</label>
			</Flex>
			<Grid columns="2" gap="2">
				<Button variant="surface">Back</Button>
				<Button>Send</Button>
			</Grid>
		</Flex>
	</Card>
</Box>
```

### Nesting

Nest another theme to modify configuration for a specific subtree. Configuration is inherited from the parent.

```jsx live=true scroll=true line=16,32
<Card size="2">
	<Flex gap="6">
		<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
			<Heading as="h5" size="2">
				Global
			</Heading>
			<Grid gap="1">
				<Text as="div" weight="bold" size="2" mb="1">
					Feedback
				</Text>
				<TextArea placeholder="Write your feedback…" />
			</Grid>
			<Button>Send</Button>
		</Flex>

		<Theme __accentColor__="cyan" __radius__="full">
			<Card size="2">
				<Flex gap="6">
					<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
						<Heading as="h5" size="2">
							Child
						</Heading>
						<Grid gap="1">
							<Text as="div" weight="bold" size="2" mb="1">
								Feedback
							</Text>
							<TextArea placeholder="Write your feedback…" />
						</Grid>
						<Button>Send</Button>
					</Flex>

					<Theme __accentColor__="orange">
						<Card size="2">
							<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
								<Heading as="h5" size="2">
									Grandchild
								</Heading>
								<Grid gap="1">
									<Text as="div" weight="bold" size="2" mb="1">
										Feedback
									</Text>
									<TextArea placeholder="Write your feedback…" />
								</Grid>
								<Button>Send</Button>
							</Flex>
						</Card>
					</Theme>
				</Flex>
			</Card>
		</Theme>
	</Flex>
</Card>
```

### Component overrides

Override configuration per component by passing any supported prop directly to that component.

```jsx live=true line=15,20
<Box maxWidth="400px">
	<Card size="2">
		<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
			<Grid gap="1">
				<Text as="div" weight="bold" size="2" mb="1">
					Feedback
				</Text>
				<TextArea placeholder="Write your feedback…" />
			</Grid>
			<Flex asChild justify="between">
				<label>
					<Text color="gray" size="2">
						Attach screenshot?
					</Text>
					<Switch
						size="1"
						__color__="orange"
						__radius__="full"
						defaultChecked
					/>
				</label>
			</Flex>
			<Grid columns="2" gap="2">

# Radix Colors - Complete Documentation

> Radix Colors is a gorgeous, accessible color system for designing beautiful websites and apps.

# Overview

## Aliasing

How to use Radix Colors.

# Aliasing

A guide to providing semantic aliases for colors.

## Semantic aliases

Referencing color scales by their actual scale name can work well, like `blue` and `red`. But often, creating semantic aliases like `accent`, `primary`, `neutral`, or `brand` can be helpful, especially when it comes to theming.

With this approach, you will likely run into issues where you need to use the same scale for multiple semantics. Common examples include:

- If you map `yellow` to "warning", you might also need `yellow` to communicate "pending".
- If you map `red` to "danger", you might also need `red` to communicate "error" or "rejected".
- If you map `green` to "success", you might also need `green` to communicate "valid".
- If you map `blue` to "accent", you might also need `blue` to communicate "info".

In this scenario, you can choose to define multiple semantic aliases which map to the same scale.

Or you can simply recommend that your teammates defer to the original scale name for situations where there is no appropriate semantic alias.

## Use case aliases

Each step in Radix Colors scales is designed for a specific use case. To help your team know which step to use, you can provide aliases based on the designed use cases.

Again, with this approach, you will likely run into issues where you need to use the same step for multiple use cases. Common examples include:

- Step 9 is designed for solid backgrounds, but it also may work for input placeholder text.
- Step 8 is designed for hovered component borders, but it also works well for focus rings.

In these cases, you can choose to define multiple aliases which map to the same step.

Or you can simply recommend that your teammates defer to the original step number for situations where use cases don't have an alias.

## Mutable aliases

When designing for both light and dark modes, you sometimes need to map a variable to one color in light mode, and another color in dark mode. Common examples include:

- Components that have a white background in light mode and a subtle gray background in dark mode. For example, Card, Popover, DropdownMenu, HoverCard, Dialog etc.
- Components that have a transparent black background in light mode and a transparent white background in dark mode. For example, Tooltip.
- Shadows that are saturated, transparent gray in light mode, and pure black in dark mode.
- An overlay that is light transparent black in light mode, and a darker transparent black in dark mode.

Avoid using specific variable names like "CardBg", or "Tooltip", because you will likely need to use each variable for multiple use cases.

## Renaming scales

If you wish, you can rename scales. Reasons might include:

- Rename a saturated gray to `gray` to keep things simple.
- Rename `sky` or `grass` to `blue` or `green` to keep the naming intuitive.
- Rename a scale to match your brand, like how Discord use `blurple`.

## Custom palettes

How to create custom Radix Colors palettes.

# Custom palettes

Learn how to create custom Radix Colors palettes.

Use the [custom color palette tool](/colors/custom) to generate a Radix Colors scale based just on a couple reference colors. Once you are happy with the result, paste the generated CSS into your project and use them the same way you would use the regular Radix Colors scales.

The generated scales are based on the Radix Colors scales themselves, so they will work well with similar component designs. As long as you use a reasonable background color, the contrast ratios will be similar to what Radix Colors provide.

## What you get

Your custom color palette will include Radix Colors steps 1 through 12, as well as their alpha variants and wide-gamut color definitions. Wide-gamut color definitions are needed to ensure that alpha colors are displayed with full saturation in wide-gamut color spaces, such as on Apple’s displays that support P3. This is because alpha blending works differently in P3 than in sRGB.

Learn about the base palette composition in the [Understanding the scale](/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale) guide. The generated CSS also includes a few extra colors used exclusively in [Radix Themes](/themes/docs), such as:

- Surface color, used by certain `variant="surface"` components
- Indicator color, used by components like Checkbox, Radio, and Tabs
- Track color, used by components like Slider and Progress Bar

Feel free to remove colors from the generated CSS that you don’t need.

## Color formats

You can use any common CSS color format in the input fields, or even wide-gamut color spaces, such as `color(display-p3 1 0.5 0)`. The generated CSS will provide the closest sRGB fallbacks.

## Dark theme

To generate dark theme colors, toggle the appearance to dark in the website header. Make sure to paste the generated CSS after your light theme color overrides.

/>
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/blue.css"
/>
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/green.css"
/>
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/red.css"
/>
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/gray-dark.css"
/>
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radix-ui/colors@latest/blue-dark.css"

How to use Radix Colors with various styling solutions.

Radix Colors scales are just simple JavaScript objects, so you can use them with your preferred styling solution easily. Below you can find usage examples for popular styling solutions.

## Vanilla CSS

Radix Colors provides the colors bundled as raw CSS files. You can import them directly in your files when using a bundler, such as Parcel or Webpack.

```css
/* Import only the scales you need */
@import "@radix-ui/colors/gray.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/blue.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/green.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/red.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/gray-dark.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/blue-dark.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/green-dark.css";
@import "@radix-ui/colors/red-dark.css";

/* Use the colors as CSS variables */
.button {
	background-color: var(--blue-4);
	color: var(--blue-11);
	border-color: var(--blue-7);
}
.button:hover {
	background-color: var(--blue-5);
	border-color: var(--blue-8);
}
```

```html
<!-- For dark mode, apply a `.dark` class to <body> or a parent. -->
<body class="dark">
	<button class="button">Button</button>
</body>
```

## styled-components

```js
import {
	gray,
	blue,
	red,
	green,
	grayDark,
	blueDark,
	redDark,
	greenDark,
} from "@radix-ui/colors";
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

// Create your theme
const theme = {
	colors: {
		...gray,
		...blue,
		...red,
		...green,
	},
};

// Create your dark theme
const darkTheme = {
	colors: {
		...grayDark,
		...blueDark,
		...redDark,
		...greenDark,
	},
};

// Use the colors in your styles
const Button = styled.button`
	background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.blue4};
	color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.blue11};
	border-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.blue7};
	&:hover {
		background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.blue5};
		border-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.blue8};
	}
`;

// Wrap your app with the theme provider and apply your theme to it
export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
			<Button>Radix Colors</Button>
		</ThemeProvider>
	);
}
```

## emotion

Usage with emotion is almost identical to the styled-components docs above, aside from the different imports.

```js
import {
	gray,
	blue,
	red,
	green,
	grayDark,
	blueDark,
	redDark,
	greenDark,
} from "@radix-ui/colors";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@emotion/react";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";
```

## vanilla-extract

```js
import {
	gray,
	blue,
	red,
	green,
	grayDark,
	blueDark,
	redDark,
	greenDark,
} from "@radix-ui/colors";
import { createTheme } from "@vanilla-extract/css";

export const [theme, vars] = createTheme({
	colors: {
		...gray,
		...blue,
		...red,
		...green,
	},
});

export const darkTheme = createTheme(vars, {
	colors: {
		...grayDark,
		...blueDark,
		...redDark,
		...greenDark,
	},
});

// Use the colors in your styles
export const styles = {
	button: style({
		backgroundColor: vars.colors.blue4,
		color: vars.colors.blue11,
		borderColor: vars.colors.blue7,
		":hover": {
			backgroundColor: vars.colors.blue5,
			borderColor: vars.colors.blue8,
		},
	}),
};

// Apply your theme to it
export default function App() {
	return (
		<body className={theme}>
			<button className={styles.button}>Radix Colors</button>
		</body>
	);
}
```

A guide to composing a color palette with Radix Colors.

## Choosing a brand scale

Radix provides a number of scales you could use for your brand or accent color.

Scales designed for white foreground text:

### Custom brand colors

Radix Colors are not intended to be customised. They’re designed to be accessible, well-balanced, and harmonious. Any customisation would likely break these features.

If you need custom brand colors, we recommend adding custom scales alongside Radix scales.

For example, you could use Radix Colors for your gray scale and your semantic scales, then add custom brand/accent colors.

## Choosing a gray scale

Radix Colors provides a pure gray and a few tinted gray scales.

- `gray` is pure gray
- `mauve` is based on a purple hue
- `slate` is based on a blue hue
- `sage` is based on a green hue
- `olive` is based on a lime hue
- `sand` is based on a yellow hue

### Neutral pairing

If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `gray` will work well with any hue or palette.

### Natural pairing

Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonius vibe.

## Choosing semantic scales

For most projects, you will need colors to communicate semantic meaning. Here are some common pairings that work well in Western culture.

- **Error**: `red`, `ruby`, `tomato`, `crimson`
- **Success**: `green`, `teal`, `jade`, `grass`, `mint`
- **Warning**: `yellow`, `amber`, `orange`
- **Info**: `blue`, `indigo`, `sky`, `cyan`

In many cases, you might eventually need most of the scales, for one reason or another. Your app may support multiplayer mode, where you assign a color to each user. Your app may have a labelling feature, where your users assign a color to a task. Your app may use badges to communicate “pending” or “rejected” states.

Radix Colors are well-balanced, and designed to work in harmony. So for product communication, most color pairings will work.

## Choosing text scales

Steps 11 and 12 are designed for low-contrast text and high-contrast text respectively. Depending on the vibe you want, you can use your accent scale or your gray scale.

Using your accent scale will result in a more colorful vibe.

Using your gray scale will result in a more functional vibe.

The difference may seem subtle, but it can make a huge difference with a whole page of text.

You may want to experiment with using your accent scale for text in your marketing sites, and your gray scale for text in your apps.

## Use cases

How to use Radix Colors.

# Understanding the scale

Learn which scale step is the most appropriate for each use case.

## Use cases

There are 12 steps in each scale. Each step was designed for at least one specific use case.

This table is a simple overview of the most common use case for each step. However, there are many exceptions and caveats to factor in, which are covered in further detail below.

## Steps 1–2: Backgrounds

Steps `1` and `2` are designed for app backgrounds and subtle component backgrounds. You can use them interchangeably, depending on the vibe you're going for.

Appropriate applications include:

- Main app background
- Striped table background
- Code block background
- Card background
- Sidebar background
- Canvas area background

## Steps 3–5: Component backgrounds

Steps `3`, `4`, and `5` are designed for UI component backgrounds.

- Step `3` is for normal states.
- Step `4` is for hover states.
- Step `5` is for pressed or selected states.

If your component has a transparent background in its default state, you can use Step `3` for its hover state.

## Steps 6–8: Borders

Steps `6`, `7`, and `8` are designed for borders.

- Step `6` is designed for subtle borders on components which are not interactive. For example sidebars, headers, cards, alerts, and separators.
- Step `7` is designed for subtle borders on interactive components.
- Step `8` is designed for stronger borders on interactive components and focus rings.

## Steps 9–10: Solid backgrounds

Steps `9` and `10` are designed for solid backgrounds.

Step `9` has the highest chroma of all steps in the scale. In other words, it's the purest step, the step mixed with the least amount of white or black. Because `9` is the purest step, it has a wide range of applications:

- Website/App backgrounds
- Website section backgrounds
- Header backgrounds
- Component backgrounds
- Graphics/Logos
- Overlays
- Coloured shadows
- Accent borders

Step `10` is designed for component hover states, where step `9` is the component's normal state background.

## Steps 11–12: Text

Steps `11` and `12` are designed for text.

- Step `11` is designed for low-contrast text.
- Step `12` is designed for high-contrast text.
