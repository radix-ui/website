How to use Radix Colors.

# Understanding the scale

Learn which scale step is the most appropriate for each use case.

## Use cases

There are 12 steps in each scale. Each step was designed for at least one specific use case.

This table is a simple overview of the most common use case for each step. However, there are many exceptions and caveats to factor in, which are covered in further detail below.

## Steps 1–2: Backgrounds

Steps `1` and `2` are designed for app backgrounds and subtle component backgrounds. You can use them interchangeably, depending on the vibe you're going for.

Appropriate applications include:

- Main app background
- Striped table background
- Code block background
- Card background
- Sidebar background
- Canvas area background

## Steps 3–5: Component backgrounds

Steps `3`, `4`, and `5` are designed for UI component backgrounds.

- Step `3` is for normal states.
- Step `4` is for hover states.
- Step `5` is for pressed or selected states.

If your component has a transparent background in its default state, you can use Step `3` for its hover state.

## Steps 6–8: Borders

Steps `6`, `7`, and `8` are designed for borders.

- Step `6` is designed for subtle borders on components which are not interactive. For example sidebars, headers, cards, alerts, and separators.
- Step `7` is designed for subtle borders on interactive components.
- Step `8` is designed for stronger borders on interactive components and focus rings.

## Steps 9–10: Solid backgrounds

Steps `9` and `10` are designed for solid backgrounds.

Step `9` has the highest chroma of all steps in the scale. In other words, it's the purest step, the step mixed with the least amount of white or black. Because `9` is the purest step, it has a wide range of applications:

- Website/App backgrounds
- Website section backgrounds
- Header backgrounds
- Component backgrounds
- Graphics/Logos
- Overlays
- Coloured shadows
- Accent borders

Step `10` is designed for component hover states, where step `9` is the component's normal state background.

## Steps 11–12: Text

Steps `11` and `12` are designed for text.

- Step `11` is designed for low-contrast text.
- Step `12` is designed for high-contrast text.
