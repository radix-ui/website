# Radix Themes - Complete Documentation

> Radix Themes is a styled component library built on Radix Primitives with a beautiful default theme.

# Overview

## Getting started

Install Radix Themes and start building in minutes

# Getting started

Install Radix Themes and start building in minutes.

Radix Themes is a pre-styled component library that is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration. If you are looking for the unstyled components, go to [Radix Primitives](/primitives).

## Installation

Getting up and running is quick and easy.

### 1. Install Radix Themes

Install the package from your command line.

### 2. Import the CSS file

Import the global CSS file at the root of your application.

```ts
import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
```

### 3. Add the Theme component

Add `Theme` to your application, wrapping the root component inside of `body`.

```jsx line=7,9
import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export default function () {
	return (
		<html>
			<body>
				<Theme>
					<MyApp />
				</Theme>
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

### 4. Start building

You are now ready to use Radix Themes components.

```jsx
import { Flex, Text, Button } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export default function MyApp() {
	return (
		<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
			<Text>Hello from Radix Themes :)</Text>
			<Button>Let's go</Button>
		</Flex>
	);
}
```

## Customizing your theme

Configuration is managed and applied via the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) component.

### Basic configuration

Pass [configuration](/themes/docs/components/theme) to the `Theme` to customize appearance.

```jsx line=1
<Theme accentColor="crimson" grayColor="sand" radius="large" scaling="95%">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

### Using the theme panel

`ThemePanel` is a drop-in component that allows you to preview the theme in real time. Visit the [component playground](/themes/playground) to see it in action.

To add `ThemePanel` to your app, import it from the package and drop it inside your root `Theme`.

```jsx line=7
import { Theme, ThemePanel } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export default function () {
	return (
		<Theme>
			<MyApp />
			<ThemePanel />
		</Theme>
	);
}
```

## Layout

Get the layout concerns right.

# Layout

Get the layout concerns right.

## Layout components

Layout components are used to separate layout responsibilities from content and interactivity. This is _the_ separation of concerns that makes your app maintainable and easy to reason about, and understanding these principles is key to building your interfaces effectively.

### Box

[Box](/themes/docs/components/box) is the most fundamental layout component. Box is used to:

- Provide spacing to child elements.
- Impose sizing constraints on content.
- Control layout behaviour within flex and grid containers.
- Hide content based on screen size using its responsive `display` prop.

### Flex

[Flex](/themes/docs/components/flex) component does everything that Box can do, but comes with an additional set of props to organize items along an axis. It provides convenient access to the CSS [flexbox properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### Grid

[Grid](/themes/docs/components/grid) is used to organize the content in columns and rows. Like Box and Flex, it’s made to provide convenient access to the underlying CSS [grid properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) without any magic of its own.

### Section

[Section](/themes/docs/components/section) provides a consistent vertical spacing between the larger parts of your page content, creating a sense of hierarchy and separation. There’s just a few pre-defined sizes for different spacing levels to keep things simple and consistent.

### Container

[Container](/themes/docs/components/container)’s sole responsibility is to provide a consistent `max-width` to the content it wraps. Like Section, it comes just with a couple of pre-defined sizes that work well with common breakpoints and typical content widths for comfortable reading.

***

## Common layout props

Each layout component has a set of it’s own specialized props and also a shared set of common layout props. All layout props support [responsive object values](/themes/docs/theme/breakpoints).

### Padding

Padding props can access the [space scale steps](/themes/docs/theme/spacing) or accept any valid [CSS padding value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding).

```jsx
<Box p="4" />
<Box p="100px">
<Box p={{ sm: '6', lg: '9' }}>
```

### Width

Width props accept any valid [CSS width value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width).

```jsx
<Box width="100px" />
<Box width={{ md: '100vw', xl: '1400px' }} />
```

### Height

Height props accept any valid [CSS height value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height).

```jsx
<Box height="100px" />
<Box height={{ md: '100vh', xl: '600px' }} />
```

### Positioning

Positioning props can change how the element is placed relative to the normal flow of the document. As usual, the corresponding CSS values are accepted for each property, and the [space scale steps](/themes/docs/theme/spacing) can be used for the offset values.

```jsx
<Box position="relative" />
<Box position={{ initial: "relative", lg: "sticky" }} />

<Box inset="4" />
<Box inset={{ initial: "0", xl: "auto" }} />

<Box left="4" />
<Box left={{ initial: "0", xl: "auto" }} />
```

### Flex children

Each layout component has props used to control the style when it is a child of a flex container.

```jsx
<Box flexBasis="100%" />
<Box flexShrink="0">
<Box flexGrow={{ initial: "0", lg: "1" }} />
```

### Grid children

Each layout component has props used to control the style when it is a child of a grid container.

```jsx
<Box gridArea="header" />

<Box gridColumn="1 / 3" />
<Box gridColumnStart="2">
<Box gridColumnEnd={{ initial: "-1", md: "3", lg: "auto" }} />

<Box gridRow="1 / 3" />
<Box gridRowStart="2">
<Box gridRowEnd={{ initial: "-1", md: "3", lg: "auto" }} />
```

***

## Margin props

Margin props are available on most components in order to provide spacing around the elements. They are not exclusive to layout components.

Margin props can access the [space scale steps](/themes/docs/theme/spacing) or accept any valid [CSS margin value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)

```jsx
<Button m="4" />
<Button m="100px">
<Button m={{ sm: '6', lg: '9' }}>
```

The margin props may be unavailable on components that don’t render a HTML node or rely on their Root part for layout.

***

## Standalone usage

If needed, it’s possible to use _just_ the layout component from Radix Themes. Just make sure that JavaScript tree-shaking works on your side, and import the CSS that powers the layout styles:

```jsx
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout.css";
```

You’ll still have to wrap your app with `Theme` to provide the space scale and scaling factor settings.

### Upgrade guide

This release introduces a number of breaking changes. Please follow the steps below to upgrade.

#### General

- Multi-part components now don’t export named parts anymore. Use dot notation instead, which was revised to work with React Server Components. For example:
  - `DialogRoot` → `Dialog.Root`
  - `DialogTrigger` → `Dialog.Trigger`
  - `DialogContent` → `Dialog.Content`
  - …and so on for all multi-part components:
    - `AlertDialog`
    - `Callout`
    - `ContextMenu`
    - `Dialog`
    - `DropdownMenu`
    - `HoverCard`
    - `Popover`
    - `RadioGroup`
    - `Select`
    - `Table`
    - `Tabs`
    - `TextField`
- Package internals such as prop definitions and helpers are no longer available from the root `@radix-ui/themes` import entry point.
  - Import them from `@radix-ui/themes/props` and `@radix-ui/themes/helpers` instead.

#### Props

- The `width` and `height` props on layout components don't map to space scale anymore. Find and replace your `width` and `height` prop usage with the corresponding [space scale](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/space.css) steps:
  - `width="1"` → `width="4px"`
  - `width="2"` → `width="8px"`
  - `width="3"` → `width="12px"`
  - `width="4"` → `width="16px"`
  - `width="5"` → `width="24px"`
  - `width="6"` → `width="32px"`
  - `width="7"` → `width="40px"`
  - `width="8"` → `width="48px"`
  - `width="9"` → `width="64px"`
  - …and so on for `height`
  - Make sure to update responsive object syntax as well
  - You can also use `var(--space-1)` to `var(--space-9)` instead of hardcoded values.
- The `shrink` and `grow` props on layout components were renamed
  - `shrink` → `flexShrink`
  - `grow` → `flexGrow`

#### Colors

If you were using the following tokens for your custom components, make sure to replace the corresponding references.

- `--color-surface-accent` → `--accent-surface`
- Contrast colors were renamed:
  - `--accent-9-contrast` → `--accent-contrast`
  - `--red-9-contrast` → `--red-contrast`
  - `--pink-9-contrast` → `--pink-contrast`
  - `--blue-9-contrast` → `--blue-contrast`
  - …and so on for all scales
- Added a new focus color scale. Rename the following tokens:
  - `--color-autofill-root` → `--focus-a3`
  - `--color-focus-root` → `--focus-8`
  - `--color-selection-root` → `--focus-a5`
- `--gray-2-translucent` and the corresponding tinted gray colors were removed.
  - Use `--color-panel-translucent` in combination with a backdrop blur filter instead.

#### Components

- `AlertDialog`, `Dialog` now have `maxWidth="600px"` by default on the Content part.
  - This is slightly larger than the previous `580px` value. If you use dialogs that need a different width, override `maxWidth` with your own value.
- `Badge` has a new `size="3"`, `size="2"` is now much smaller, and `size="1"` dimensions were tweaked
  - Replace your `size="2"` usage with `size="3"`
- `Card` internal HTML structure and styles were reworked and now renders a single HTML node. Make sure that your code works as expected if you were relying on any of the implementation quirks to override styles or behaviour.
  - If you need to override the Card’s background color on variants other than `ghost`, use `--card-background-color` variable instead of assigning `background-color` directly, or set your background color on an `<Inset p="current">` element nested as the first child of the Card.
  - Check your Card instances that uses `asChild` or is `asChild`’ed onto by a parent component. (The common case with link or button card without any extra styles will work as expected).
- `HoverCard` and `Popover` now have `maxWidth="480px"` by default on the Content part.
  - If you use popovers and hover cards that need a wider width, override `maxWidth` with your own value.
- `RadioGroup` internal HTML structure and styles were reworked and is now designed to display an optional text label when passing `children` to the `Item` part. The `Root` part now also provides flex column styles and spacing.
  - If you need lower-level control, you can use the `Radio` component instead
- `Section` has a new `size="3"`
  - Update all your Sections that used `size="3"` to `size="4"`
- `Tabs` underlying letter/word spacing CSS variables were renamed to support both `Tabs` and `TabNav` components. If you were using them, rename them to the new values:
  - `--tabs-trigger-active-letter-spacing` → `--tab-active-letter-spacing`
  - `--tabs-trigger-active-word-spacing` → `--tab-active-word-spacing`
  - `--tabs-trigger-inactive-letter-spacing` → `--tab-inactive-letter-spacing`
  - `--tabs-trigger-inactive-word-spacing` → `--tab-inactive-word-spacing`
- `TextField` now only has 2 parts: `Root` and `Slot`, dropping the `Input` part and simplifying how props are forwarded.
  - All `TextField.Input` parts used **without** `TextField.Root` should be renamed to `TextField.Root`
  - All `TextField.Input` parts used **within** `TextField.Root` should be removed and their props should be put directly on the `TextField.Root` part
  - All `TextField.Slot` parts placed to the right of `TextField.Input` will need `side="right"` prop. However, no adjustment is needed when two slots were used within one `TextField`, e.g. one slot on the left and another one on the right. In that case, the slots will be automatically placed on different sides.
  - Make sure that your code works as expected if you were relying on any of the implementation quirks to override styles or behaviour.
- `Theme` does not set body background color automatically anymore. The background color is now provided by the root `Theme` by default. The CSS variable `--color-page-background` is no longer available.
  - In most cases, it can be safely replaced with `--color-background` available on the `.radix-themes` element.
- `Tooltip` now has `maxWidth="360px"` by default on the Content part.
  - If you use tooltips that need to be wider, override `maxWidth` with your own value.

### Full changelog

- General
  - Package structure
    - Improve ESM compatibility
    - Improve tree-shaking of individual component parts
    - **\[Breaking]** Drop named exports for multi-part components
      - Note: Our new approach allows dot notation to work reliably in server components too
    - **\[Breaking]** Remove component prop definitions and internal helpers from the root `@radix-ui/themes` import entry point and export them from `@radix-ui/themes/props` and `@radix-ui/themes/helpers` to make it possible to build your own component library on top of Radix Themes using the same techniques.
    - Add a wildcard entry point to the package to allow direct access to the package internals as an escape hatch if you have a complex tooling setup that can’t support modern module resolution rules
    - Add extra CSS file exports for advanced use-cases:
      - Export individual `tokens.css`, `components.css`, and `utilities.css` files in case you need fine-grained control of the CSS precedence. For example, this allows to import Radix Themes `utilities.css` after your own CSS, and everything else before that.
      - Additionally to the above, you can customise which colors to import. Instead of importing `tokens.css`, you can also import `tokens/base.css` and `tokens/colors/*.css`, where `*` corresponds to the names of the accent and gray colors you need in your project.
      - Export `layout.css` that only includes styles for the layout components (Box, Flex, Grid, Container, Section). Individual exports `layout/tokens.css`, `layout/components.css`, and `layout/utilities.css` are also available to support the above use-case.
  - Props
    - Add the following props to all layout components:
      - `minWidth`, `maxWidth`
      - `minHeight`, `maxHeight`
      - `flexBasis`, `flexShrink`, `flexGrow`
      - `gridColumn`, `gridColumnStart`, `gridColumnEnd`
      - `gridRow`, `gridRowStart`, `gridRowEnd`
      - `overflow`, `overflowX`, `overflowY`
    - Rework all layout props to allow arbitrary CSS values, including when used with the responsive object syntax. Props that support arbitrary values include:
      - `width`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`
      - `height`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`
      - `m`, `mx`, `my`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml`
      - `p`, `px`, `py`, `pt`, `pr`, `pb`, `pl`
      - `inset`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
      - `gap`, `gapX`, `gapY`
      - `flexBasis`, `flexShrink`, `flexGrow`
      - `gridColumn`, `gridColumnStart`, `gridColumnEnd`
      - `gridRow`, `gridRowStart`, `gridRowEnd`
    - **\[Breaking]** The `width` and `height` props don't map to space scale anymore. This is because in the vast majority of cases, width and height were not set to space scale, and with that, space scale as an IDE autocomplete suggestion felt odd/misleading.
    - **\[Breaking]** Rename `shrink` and `grow` props to `flexShrink` and `flexGrow`
    - Update the type signature of the layout props so that code editor suggestions use just space scale values when possible. CSS keywords and other values such as `"auto"` or `"100vw"` are still available as manual string values.
    - Document all layout props with JSDoc
    - Fix an issue with responsive props when using a breakpoints object without the `initial` key would not apply the default prop value
    - Remove the native `color`, `defaultValue`, and `defaultChecked` attributes from components that inherit them from the native HTML elements to avoid confusion with their custom implementations
    - **\[Breaking]** Rework the availability of `asChild` prop on all components and parts
  - Colors
    - Make sure `highContrast` text colors work consistently when nested within other components that accept an accent color
    - Tweak the background color of all `variant="soft"` menu items
    - **\[Breaking]** Rename `--color-surface-accent` to `--accent-surface`
    - **\[Breaking]** Rename `--accent-9-contrast`, `--red-9-contrast`, `--pink-9-contrast`, `--blue-9-contrast`, etc. to `--accent-contrast`, `--red-contrast`, `--pink-contrast`, `--blue-contrast` and so on.
    - Remove `--gray-2-translucent` and the corresponding tinted gray colors
    - Tweak `--color-surface` and `--color-panel-translucent` values
    - **\[Breaking]** Replace `--color-focus-root`, `--color-selection-root`, `--color-autofill-root` with a focus color scale, e.g. `--focus-1` – `--focus-12`, and `--focus-a1` – `--focus-a12`.

## Styling

How to approach styling with Radix Themes.

# Styling

How to approach styling with Radix Themes.

## Introduction

Radix Themes does not come with a built-in styling system. There’s no `css` or `sx` prop, and it does not use any styling libraries internally. Under the hood, it’s built with vanilla CSS.

There’s no overhead when it comes to picking a styling technology for your app.

## What you get

The components in Radix Themes are relatively closed—they come with a set of styles that aren’t always easily overridden. They are customizable within what’s allowed by their props and the theme configuration.

However, you also get access to the same CSS variables that power the Radix Themes components. You can use these tokens to create custom components that naturally feel at home in the original theme. Changes to the token system are treated as breaking.

For more information on specific tokens, refer to the corresponding guides in the [Theme section](/themes/docs/theme/overview).

## Overriding styles

Beyond simple style overrides, we recommend using the components as-is, or create your own versions using the same building blocks.

Most components do have `className` and `style` props, but if you find yourself needing to override a lot of styles, it’s a good sign that you should either:

- Try to achieve what you need with the existing props and theme configuration.
- See whether you can achieve your design by tweaking the underlying token system.
- Create your own component using lower-level building blocks, such [Primitives](/primitives) and [Colors](/colors).
- Reconsider whether Radix Themes is the right fit for your project.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is _great_. Yet, if you plan to use Radix Themes with Tailwind, keep in mind how its ergonomics may encourage you to create complex styles on the fly, sometimes reaching into the component internals without friction.

Tailwind is a different styling paradigm, which may not mix well with the idea of a closed component system where customization is achieved through props, tokens, and creating new components on top of a shared set of building blocks.

## Custom components

If you need to create a custom component, use the same building blocks that Radix Themes uses:

- [Theme](/themes/docs/theme/overview) tokens that power the components
- [Radix Primitives](/primitives), a library of accessible, unstyled components
- [Radix Colors](/colors), a color system for building beautiful websites and apps

Feel free to explore the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/tree/main/packages/radix-ui-themes) of Radix Themes to see how it is built.

## Common issues

### z-index conflicts

Out of the box, portalled Radix Themes components can be nested and stacked in any order without conflicts. For example, you can open a popover that opens a dialog, which in turn opens another popover. They all stack on top of each other in the order they were opened:

When building your own components, use the following rules to avoid z-index conflicts:

- Don’t use `z-index` values other than `auto`, `0`, or `-1` in rare cases.
- Render the elements that should stack on top of each other in portals.

Your main content and portalled content are separated by the stacking context that the styles of the root `<Theme>` component create. This allows you to stack portalled content on top of the main content without worrying about z-indices.

### Next.js import order

As of Next.js 13.0 to 14.1, the import order of CSS files in `app/**/layout.tsx` is not guaranteed, so Radix Themes may overwrite your own styles even when written correctly:

```js
import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
import "./my-styles.css";
```

This Next.js issue may come and go sporadically, or happen only in development or production.

As a workaround, you can merge all the CSS into a single file first via [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) and import just that into your layout. Alternatively, importing the styles directly in `page.tsx` files also works.

### Tailwind base styles

As of Tailwind v3, styles produced by the `@tailwind` directive are usually appended after any imported CSS, no matter the original import order. In particular, Tailwind’s [button reset](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/7361468f77500105b0559e879e121f34306e8da2/src/css/preflight.css#L197-L204) style may interfere with Radix Themes buttons, rendering certain buttons without a background color.

Workarounds:

- Don’t use `@tailwind base`
- Set up separate CSS [layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) for Tailwind and Radix Themes
- Set up [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) and manually import Tailwind base styles via `@import tailwindcss/base` before Radix Themes styles. [Example setup](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/issues/109#issuecomment-1747345743)

### Missing styles in portals

When you render a custom portal in a Radix Themes project, it will naturally appear outside of the root `<Theme>` component, which means it won’t have access to most of the theme tokens and styles. To fix that, wrap the portal content with another `<Theme>`:

```jsx line=11,18
// Implementation example of a custom dialog using the low-level Dialog primitive
// Refer to https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog
import { Dialog } from "radix-ui";
import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";

function MyCustomDialog() {
	return (
		<Dialog.Root>
			<Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
			<Dialog.Portal>
				<Theme>
					<Dialog.Overlay />
					<Dialog.Content>
						<Dialog.Title />
						<Dialog.Description />
						<Dialog.Close />
					</Dialog.Content>
				</Theme>
			</Dialog.Portal>
		</Dialog.Root>
	);
}
```

Components like Dialog and Popover in Radix Themes already handle this for you, so this is only necessary when creating your own portalled components.

### Complex CSS precedence

Usually, you’d want your custom CSS to override Radix Themes styles. However, there are cases when it is natural to expect the opposite.

Consider a simple paragraph style that just resets the browser’s default margin:

```css
.my-paragraph {
	margin: 0;
}
```

You might apply the margin prop from a `Box` onto your custom paragraph via `asChild`:

```jsx line="7,9"
import "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css";
import "./my-styles.css";

function MyApp() {
	return (
		<Theme>
			<Box asChild m="5">
				<p className="my-paragraph">My custom paragraph</p>
			</Box>
		</Theme>
	);
}
```

Yet, this won’t work intuitively. The custom styles are imported after Radix Themes styles, so they will override the margin prop. As a workaround, Radix Themes provides separate `tokens.css`, `components.css`, and `utilities.css` files that the original `styles.css` is built upon:

```jsx
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/components.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/utilities.css";
```

You can import `utilities.css` after your custom styles to ensure that the layout props work as expected with your custom styles. However, if you use Next.js, keep in mind the [import order issue](#nextjs-import-order) that’s mentioned above.

If you use [standalone layout components](/themes/docs/overview/layout#standalone-usage), split CSS files are also available for them:

```jsx
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout/tokens.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout/components.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/layout/utilities.css";
```

# Theme Configuration

## Breakpoints

Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adapative layouts.

# Breakpoints

Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adaptive layouts.

## Available sizes

Each breakpoint matches a fixed screen width. Values are `min-width` based and apply when the screen width is equal or greater.

## Usage

Most component size and layout props will accept an additional `Responsive` object shape for modifying the given prop across breakpoints.

Each size maps to a corresponding key, the value of each will be applied when the screen size is greater than or equal to the named breakpoint.

```jsx
<Heading
	size={{
		initial: "3",
		md: "5",
		xl: "7",
	}}
/>
```

## Color

Understanding the color system and it’s application in your theme.

# Color

Understanding the color system and its application in your theme.

Radix Themes comes with a number of color scales, each with their own light, dark and alpha variants. Under the hood, the color system is powered by [Radix Colors](/colors).

## Accents

Accent color is the most dominant color in your theme. It is used for primary buttons, links and other interactive elements. `accentColor` is specified directly on the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) component:

```jsx
<Theme accentColor="indigo">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

#### Available accent colors

There is a range of accent colors to choose from:

#### Accent scale anatomy

Each accent is a 12-step scale that includes a solid and a transparent variant of each color. For example, here’s the `indigo` color scale:

#### Accent scale tokens

Accent color tokens can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are accessible and consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Backgrounds */
var(--accent-1);
var(--accent-2);

/* Interactive components */
var(--accent-3);
var(--accent-4);
var(--accent-5);

/* Borders and separators */
var(--accent-6);
var(--accent-7);
var(--accent-8);

/* Solid colors */
var(--accent-9);
var(--accent-10);

/* Accessible text */
var(--accent-11);
var(--accent-12);

/* Functional colors */
var(--accent-surface);
var(--accent-indicator);
var(--accent-track);
var(--accent-contrast);
```

***

## Grays

You can also choose between a pure gray or a number of tinted grays. Your accent color will be automatically paired with a gray shade that compliments it. However, you can also specify a custom `grayColor` directly on the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) component:

```jsx
<Theme grayColor="mauve">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

#### Available gray colors

There is 6 grays to choose from. The difference may seem subtle, but it is impactful especially on pages with a lot of text or in dense UIs.

#### Gray scale anatomy

Grays are based on the same 12-step color scale that includes a solid and a transparent variant of each color. For example, here’s the `slate` color scale:

#### Gray scale tokens

Gray color tokens can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are accessible and consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Backgrounds */
var(--gray-1);
var(--gray-2);

/* Interactive components */
var(--gray-3);
var(--gray-4);
var(--gray-5);

/* Borders and separators */
var(--gray-6);
var(--gray-7);
var(--gray-8);

/* Solid colors */
var(--gray-9);
var(--gray-10);

/* Accessible text */
var(--gray-11);
var(--gray-12);

/* Functional colors */
var(--gray-surface);
var(--gray-indicator);
var(--gray-track);
var(--gray-contrast);
```

***

## Color overrides

When available, the `color` prop on the components can be used to override the theme accent.
Nested components will automatically inherit the new accent color.

```jsx live=true line=17
<Theme accentColor="indigo">
	<Flex align="start" direction={{ initial: "column", sm: "row" }} gap="4">
		<Callout.Root>
			<Callout.Icon>
				<InfoCircledIcon />
			</Callout.Icon>
			<Callout.Text>
				<Flex as="span" align="center" gap="4">
					<Text>There are new commits.</Text>
					<Button variant="surface" size="1" my="-2">
						Refresh
					</Button>
				</Flex>
			</Callout.Text>
		</Callout.Root>

		<Callout.Root color="gray">
			<Callout.Icon>
				<InfoCircledIcon />
			</Callout.Icon>
			<Callout.Text>
				<Flex as="span" align="center" gap="4">
					<Text>There are new commits.</Text>
					<Button variant="surface" size="1" my="-2">
						Refresh
					</Button>
				</Flex>
			</Callout.Text>
		</Callout.Root>
	</Flex>
</Theme>
```

#### Individual color tokens

Individual colors can be accessed directly using similar CSS variables by their corresponding names. For example, the reds are accessed via `--red-1`, `--red-2`, and so on up to `--red-12`.

***

## High contrast

Most of the time, components with a `color` prop also provide a `highContrast` option that achieves appearance that stands out against the page background:

```jsx live=true line="5"
<Flex gap="4">
	<Button variant="classic" color="gray">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button variant="classic" color="gray" highContrast>
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

## Focus and selection

Radix Themes automatically adjusts the focus and selection colors depending on the accent color of the current component. Most of the time, setting the `color` prop will intelligently change the focus and selection colors to avoid a mismatch of conflicting hues:

```jsx live=true line="1,6,9"
<Theme accentColor="indigo">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
		<Text>
			Complete your account setup in <Link href="#">settings</Link>
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray">
			Complete your account setup in <Link href="#">settings</Link>
		</Text>
		<Text color="red">
			Complete your account setup in <Link href="#">settings</Link>
		</Text>
	</Flex>
</Theme>
```

#### Focus scale tokens

Focus color tokens can be accessed using CSS variables that follow a similar naming structure like the other scales, e.g. `--focus-1`, `--focus-2`, and so on up to `--focus-12`.

Most of the components use `--focus-8` for the focus outline color.

***

## Alpha colors

Every color has an alpha variant which is designed to appear visually the same when placed over the page background. This is a powerful tool that allows colors to look naturally when overlayed over another background. All numerical color steps have a corresponding alpha variant.

```css
/* Solid colors */
var(--red-1);
var(--red-2);
...
var(--red-12);

/* Alpha colors */
var(--red-a1);
var(--red-a2);
...
var(--red-a12);
```

Alpha colors are used automatically within Radix Themes components—no additional configuration is required.

***

## Backgrounds

A number of background colors are used to create a sense of visual hierarchy in Radix Themes UIs. These colors are used for backgrounds, cards, and other surfaces.

```css
/* Page background */
var(--color-background);

/* Panel backgrounds, such as cards, tables, popovers, dropdown menus, etc. */
var(--color-panel-solid);
var(--color-panel-translucent);

/* Form component backgrounds, such as text fields, checkboxes, select, etc. */
var(--color-surface);

/* Dialog overlays */
var(--color-overlay);
```

### Panel background

The `panelBackground` prop controls whether panelled elements use a solid or a translucent background color. The default `translucent` value creates a subtle overlay effect:

```jsx
<Theme panelBackground="translucent">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

While `solid` is useful when you'd prefer to present information unobstructed.

```jsx
<Theme panelBackground="solid">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

***

## Customization

Radix Themes colors can be customized by overriding the corresponding CSS variables of the token system. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/color.css) for the full list of the color tokens.

Make sure that your CSS is applied after the Radix Themes styles so that it takes precedence.

### Brand color

You can replace a specific color with your brand color by remapping the corresponding token. Usually, you’d override **step 9** of the scale that you are using as your theme accent.

```css
.radix-themes {
	--my-brand-color: #3052f6;
	--indigo-9: var(--my-brand-color);
	--indigo-a9: var(--my-brand-color);
}
```

In this example, using solid-colored `indigo` components will now reference your custom color.

### Custom palette

You can use the [custom color palette tool](/colors/custom) to generate a custom palette based just on a couple reference colors. Once you are happy with the result, paste the generated CSS into your project. You can rename the generated colors to match the accent that you want to use in your theme.

To generate dark theme colors, toggle the appearance to use the dark theme. Make sure to paste the generated CSS after your light theme color overrides.

### Color aliasing

You may prefer to use generic color names to refer to the color shades that you want to use. For example, it is common to refer to `crimson`, `jade`, and `indigo` as `red`, `green`, and `blue` respectively.

In this case, you can remap Radix Themes tokens in place of one another and reclaim the color names you want to use:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--red-1: var(--ruby-1);
	--red-2: var(--ruby-2);
	--red-3: var(--ruby-3);
	--red-4: var(--ruby-4);
	--red-5: var(--ruby-5);
	--red-6: var(--ruby-6);
	--red-7: var(--ruby-7);
	--red-8: var(--ruby-8);
	--red-9: var(--ruby-9);
	--red-10: var(--ruby-10);
	--red-11: var(--ruby-11);
	--red-12: var(--ruby-12);

	--red-a1: var(--ruby-a1);
	--red-a2: var(--ruby-a2);
	--red-a3: var(--ruby-a3);
	--red-a4: var(--ruby-a4);
	--red-a5: var(--ruby-a5);
	--red-a6: var(--ruby-a6);
	--red-a7: var(--ruby-a7);
	--red-a8: var(--ruby-a8);
	--red-a9: var(--ruby-a9);
	--red-a10: var(--ruby-a10);
	--red-a11: var(--ruby-a11);
	--red-a12: var(--ruby-a12);

	--red-surface: var(--ruby-surface);
	--red-indicator: var(--ruby-indicator);
	--red-track: var(--ruby-track);
	--red-contrast: var(--ruby-contrast);
}
```

In this example, using the `red` color in Radix Themes components and tokens would now reference the original `ruby` scale.

***

## Individual CSS files

Color definitions comprise around 20% of the total CSS size that Radix Themes ships with.

If you’d prefer to reduce your CSS bundle size and have access just to the colors you use, you can import the individual CSS files for each color module. Here’s a sample setup:

```ts
// Base theme tokens
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/base.css";

// Include just the colors you use, for example `ruby`, `teal`, and `slate`.
// Remember to import the gray tint that matches your theme setting.
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/colors/ruby.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/colors/teal.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/tokens/colors/slate.css";

// Rest of the CSS
import "@radix-ui/themes/components.css";
import "@radix-ui/themes/utilities.css";
```

Please note that the colors you didn’t import will still be accepted by the `color` prop in React. Also, make sure that your developer tooling [preserves](/themes/docs/overview/styling#nextjs-import-order) the order of the imported CSS files.

## Cursors

Customizing cursors used for interactive elements.

# Cursors

Customizing cursors used for interactive elements.

## Default cursors

By default, interactive elements that don’t link to another page use the regular arrow cursor. This also matches the browser defaults. However, disabled elements use an explicit disabled cursor.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4" wrap="wrap">
	<Flex align="center" gap="3" wrap="wrap">
		<Button>Button</Button>
		<Button asChild>
			<a href="#">Link</a>
		</Button>
		<Button disabled>Disabled</Button>
	</Flex>
	<Button variant="ghost">Ghost button</Button>
	<Link href="#" size="2">
		Link
	</Link>
	<Checkbox defaultChecked />
	<Switch defaultChecked />
	<Switch defaultChecked disabled />
</Flex>
```

## Cursor tokens

Cursor settings can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are accessible and consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Available cursor tokens */
var(--cursor-button);
var(--cursor-checkbox);
var(--cursor-disabled);
var(--cursor-link);
var(--cursor-menu-item);
var(--cursor-radio);
var(--cursor-slider-thumb);
var(--cursor-slider-thumb-active);
var(--cursor-switch);
```

## Customization

It’s common to use a pointer cursor for interactive elements. Radix Themes cursors can be customized by overriding the corresponding CSS variables of the token system.

Here’s an example of how you can customize the cursor tokens to set `cursor: pointer` for most interactive elements in the theme:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--cursor-button: pointer;
	--cursor-checkbox: pointer;
	--cursor-disabled: default;
	--cursor-link: pointer;
	--cursor-menu-item: pointer;
	--cursor-radio: pointer;
	--cursor-slider-thumb: grab;
	--cursor-slider-thumb-active: grabbing;
	--cursor-switch: pointer;
}
```

Make sure that your CSS is applied after the Radix Themes styles so that it takes precedence.

## Dark mode

Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.

# Dark mode

Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.

## Overview

Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or styling.

## Basic usage

By default, the root `Theme` appearance is `light`. To set a different appearance pass it via the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

```jsx line=1
<Theme appearance="dark">
	<MyApp />
</Theme>
```

## Inheriting system appearance

A common requirement is to inherit the appearance setting from a user’s system preferences.

This is a deceptively complex problem to solve given SSR, SSG and client side hydration considerations. To make implementation easier, we recommend integrating with a theme switching library.

### With next-themes

Integration with `next-themes` is simple and straightforward because Radix Themes implements matching class names.

To enable dark mode, use `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`.

```jsx line=6
import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function () {
	return (
		<ThemeProvider attribute="class">
			<Theme>
				<MyApp />
			</Theme>
		</ThemeProvider>
	);
}
```

### With other libraries

Any library that supports class switching is compatible. You’ll just need to ensure that the appended class names match those supported by Radix Themes:

- `className="light"`
- `className="light-theme"`
- `className="dark"`
- `className="dark-theme"`

## Theme overview

Use the Theme component to change the look and feel of your UI.

# Theme overview

Use the Theme component to change the look and feel of your UI.

## Anatomy

The [Theme component](/themes/docs/components/theme) defines the overall visual look of your application. It can be customized by passing a minimal set of configuration options.

```jsx live=true
<Theme
	accentColor="mint"
	grayColor="gray"
	panelBackground="solid"
	scaling="100%"
	radius="full"
>
	<ThemesVolumeControlExample />
</Theme>
```

A well tuned set of defaults is provided to get you started, but don’t be afraid to play with all of the available options to find the right visual style for your application. Check out the [Playground](/themes/playground) to see what effect each option has.

## Variants

Variants are visual variations of a component which are used to create visual hierarchies and communicate relative importance.

Each component offers a different set of variants, though all are designed to be consistent and complimentary with each other.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Button variant="classic">
		Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
	</Button>
	<Button variant="solid">
		Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
	</Button>
	<Button variant="soft">
		Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

## Examples

Using a combination of component variants alongside customized theme settings allows you to create a multitude of unique-looking interfaces.

For example you could create:

- [Music applications](/themes/example-music-app)
- [Ecommerce product elements](/themes/example-ecommerce)
- [SaaS dashboards](/themes/example-dashboard)

Or any number of differing treatments and styles.

## Tokens

Tokens provide direct access to theme values and give you flexibility to build and customize your own themed components.

For all available theme tokens see the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/tree/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens), or read more about each type of token in the relevant theme pages.

## Radius

Choosing the right radius setting in your theme.

# Radius

Choosing the right radius setting in your theme.

## Theme setting

Theme `radius` setting manages the radius factor applied to the components:

```jsx line="1"
<Theme radius="medium">
	<TextField.Root size="3" placeholder="Reply…">
		<TextField.Slot side="right" px="1">
			<Button size="2">Send</Button>
		</TextField.Slot>
	</TextField.Root>
</Theme>
```

The resulting `border-radius` is contextual and differs depending on the component. For example, when set to `full`, a [Button](/themes/docs/components/button) becomes pill-shaped, while a [Checkbox](/themes/docs/components/checkbox) will never become fully rounded to prevent any confusion between it and a [Radio](/themes/docs/components/radio).

```jsx live=true
<Theme radius="full">
	<Flex align="center" gap="3">
		<Button>Save</Button>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
		<Checkbox defaultChecked />
	</Flex>
</Theme>
```

## Radius overrides

Certain components allow you to override the radius factor using their own `radius` prop.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="3">
	<Button radius="none">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="small">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="medium">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="large">Save</Button>
	<Button radius="full">Save</Button>
</Flex>
```

Components that render panels, like Card, Dialog, and Popover, among others, won’t have the `radius` prop, but will inherit the radius setting from the theme. The `radius` prop is also unavailable on most text-based components.

## Radius scale

Radius values used in the components are derived from a 6-step scale.

While you can’t use a specific step on a particular component directly—the `radius` prop is used to set just the radius factor—you can use the radius scale to style your own components.

Radius tokens are accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Radius values that automatically respond to the radius factor */
var(--radius-1);
var(--radius-2);
var(--radius-3);
var(--radius-4);
var(--radius-5);
var(--radius-6);

/* A multiplier that controls the theme radius */
var(--radius-factor);

/*
 * A variable used to calculate a fully rounded radius.
 * Usually used within a CSS `max()` function.
 */
var(--radius-full);

/*
 * A variable used to calculate radius of a thumb element.
 * Usually used within a CSS `max()` function.
 */
var(--radius-thumb);
```

## Shadows

Understanding the shadow styles used in your theme.

# Shadows

Understanding the shadow styles used in your theme.

Shadows used in the components are derived from a 6-step scale. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/shadow.css) for the actual values used to achieve these shadows.

#### Shadow tokens

Shadow tokens can be accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Inset shadow */
var(--shadow-1);

/* Shadows for variant="classic" panels, like Card */
var(--shadow-2);
var(--shadow-3);

/* Shadows for smaller overlay panels, like Hover Card and Popover */
var(--shadow-4);
var(--shadow-5);

/* Shadows for larger overlay panels, like Dialog */
var(--shadow-6);
```

## Spacing

Overview of the space scale and scaling options.

# Spacing

Overview of the space scale and scaling options.

## Space scale

Spacing values are derived from a 9-step scale, which is used for props such as margin and padding. These props accept numeric strings from `"1"` to `"9"`, which correspond to the steps in the scale below.

#### Space scale tokens

Space scale tokens can be also accessed using CSS variables. You can use these tokens to style your custom components, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
/* Space scale */
var(--space-1);
var(--space-2);
var(--space-3);
var(--space-4);
var(--space-5);
var(--space-6);
var(--space-7);
var(--space-8);
var(--space-9);
```

## Scaling

Values which affect layout (spacing, font size, line height) scale relatively to each other based on the `scaling` value defined in your Theme. This setting allows you to scale the UI density uniformly across your entire application.

```jsx line="1"
<Theme scaling="100%">
	<Card variant="surface">
		<Flex gap="3" align="center">
			<Avatar size="3" src={person.image} fallback={person.name} />
			<Box>
				<Text as="div" size="2" weight="bold">
					{person.name}
				</Text>
				<Text as="div" size="2" color="gray">
					Approved invoice <Link>#3461</Link>
				</Text>
			</Box>
		</Flex>
	</Card>
</Theme>
```

#### Scaling factor

The scaling factor token can be accessed using the `--scaling` CSS variable. If you need to use different scaling factors in your app, you can use this token in your custom styles, ensuring they are consistent with the rest of your theme.

```css
.MyCustomComponent {
	width: calc(200px * var(--scaling));
}
```

## Typography

Guidance for using and tuning typography.

# Typography

Guidance for using and tuning typography.

## Base components

Use [Text](/themes/docs/components/text) and [Heading](/themes/docs/components/heading) components to render titles and body copy. These components share `size` and `weight` props and map to the underlying type system to ensure consistent typography throughout your app.

```jsx live=true
<Heading mb="2" size="4">Typographic principles</Heading>
<Text>The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.</Text>
```

## Formatting components

Compose formatting components to add [emphasis](/themes/docs/components/em), [signal importance](/themes/docs/components/strong), present [code](/themes/docs/components/code) and more.

```jsx live=true
<Text>
	The <Em>most</Em> important thing to remember is,{" "}
	<Strong>stay positive</Strong>.
</Text>
```

## Type scale

The typographic system is based on a 9-step `size` scale. Every step has a corresponding font size, line height and letter spacing value which are all designed to be used in combination.

```jsx live="true"
<Text size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
```

## Font weight

The following weights are supported. Weights can be [customized](/themes/docs/theme/typography#custom-font-weights) to map to your own typeface.

```jsx live="true"
<Text size="6">
	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text weight="light">Light</Text>
		<Text weight="regular">Regular</Text>
		<Text weight="medium">Medium</Text>
		<Text weight="bold">Bold</Text>
	</Flex>
</Text>
```

## Font family

By default, Radix Themes uses a system font stack for portability and legibility. Continue to the next section to learn about customizing your theme with a custom font.

## Customization

Radix Themes typography can be customized by overriding the corresponding CSS variables of the token system. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/blob/main/packages/radix-ui-themes/src/styles/tokens/typography.css) for the full list of the typographic tokens.

Make sure that your CSS is applied after the Radix Themes styles so that it takes precedence.

### Custom fonts

You can provide your own fonts, however, how you choose to import and serve them is up to you. It is only required that you specify your named fonts using the correct syntax.

To customize the font family used in your theme, remap the corresponding `font-family` tokens:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-font-family:  /* Your custom default font */ --heading-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Heading> components */ --code-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Code> components */ --strong-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Strong> components */ --em-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Em> components */ --quote-font-family:
		/* Your custom font for <Quote> components */;
}
```

### With next/font

To load custom fonts via [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font), use the [`variable`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#variable) option to define a CSS variable name. Then, add that CSS variable class to your HTML document.

```jsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
	subsets: ["latin"],
	display: "swap",
	variable: "--font-inter",
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
	return (
		<html lang="en" className={inter.variable}>
			<body>{children}</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

Finally, assign the CSS variable in your custom CSS:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-font-family: var(--font-inter);
}
```

Be aware that you may encounter css import order issues if you are running the app router. See [common styling issues](/themes/docs/overview/styling#nextjs-import-order) for more information.

### Custom font weights

To customize the exact font weights used in your theme, remap the corresponding `font-weight` tokens to your own values:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--font-weight-light: 200;
	--font-weight-regular: 300;
	--font-weight-medium: 600;
	--font-weight-bold: 800;
}
```

### Advanced settings

There’s a number of advanced typographic features that can be customized. These include a font size multiplier for certain components, font style, letter spacing, and leading trim. For example, you can customize the headings to render with a relatively larger font size than your default font, different leading trim values, and tighter letter spacing:

```css
.radix-themes {
	--heading-font-family: "Untitled Sans", sans-serif;
	--heading-font-size-adjust: 1.05;
	--heading-font-style: normal;
	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.38em;
	--heading-letter-spacing: -0.01em;
}
```

# Components

## Accessible Icon

Makes icons accessible by adding a label.

## API Reference

This component inherits all props and functionality from the [Accessible Icon primitive](/primitives/docs/utilities/accessible-icon) utility.

---

## Alert Dialog

Modal confirmation dialog that interrupts the user and expects a response.

```jsx live=true
<AlertDialog.Root>
	<AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<Button color="red">Revoke access</Button>
	</AlertDialog.Trigger>
	<AlertDialog.Content maxWidth="450px">
		<AlertDialog.Title>Revoke access</AlertDialog.Title>
		<AlertDialog.Description size="2">
			Are you sure? This application will no longer be accessible and any
			existing sessions will be expired.
		</AlertDialog.Description>

		<Flex gap="3" mt="4" justify="end">
			<AlertDialog.Cancel>
				<Button variant="soft" color="gray">
					Cancel
				</Button>
			</AlertDialog.Cancel>
			<AlertDialog.Action>
				<Button variant="solid" color="red">
					Revoke access
				</Button>
			</AlertDialog.Action>
		</Flex>
	</AlertDialog.Content>
</AlertDialog.Root>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits parts and props from the [Alert Dialog primitive](/primitives/docs/components/alert-dialog) and is visually identical to [Dialog](/themes/docs/components/dialog), though with differing semantics and behavior.

### Root

Contains all the parts of the dialog.

### Trigger

Wraps the control that will open the dialog.

### Content

Contains the content of the dialog. This component is based on the `div` element.

### Title

An accessible title that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Heading](/themes/docs/components/heading) component with a pre-defined font size and leading trim on top.

### Description

An optional accessible description that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Text](/themes/docs/components/text) component with a pre-defined font size.

If you want to remove the description entirely, remove this part and pass `aria-describedby={undefined}` to `Content`.

### Action

Wraps the control that will close the dialog. This should be distinguished visually from the `Cancel` control.

### Cancel

Wraps the control that will close the dialog. This should be distinguished visually from the `Action` control.

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control size of the dialog. It will affect the `padding` and `border-radius` of the Content.
Use it in conjunction with the `width`, `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props to control the width of the dialog.

```jsx live=true line=6,17,28,39
<Flex gap="4" align="center">
	<AlertDialog.Root>
		<AlertDialog.Trigger>
			<Button variant="soft">Size 1</Button>
		</AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<AlertDialog.Content __size__="1" maxWidth="300px">
			<Text as="p" trim="both" size="1">
				The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
			</Text>
		</AlertDialog.Content>
	</AlertDialog.Root>

	<AlertDialog.Root>
		<AlertDialog.Trigger>
			<Button variant="soft">Size 2</Button>
		</AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<AlertDialog.Content __size__="2" maxWidth="400px">
			<Text as="p" trim="both" size="2">
				The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
			</Text>
		</AlertDialog.Content>
	</AlertDialog.Root>

	<AlertDialog.Root>
		<AlertDialog.Trigger>
			<Button variant="soft">Size 3</Button>
		</AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<AlertDialog.Content __size__="3" maxWidth="500px">
			<Text as="p" trim="both" size="3">
				The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
			</Text>
		</AlertDialog.Content>
	</AlertDialog.Root>

	<AlertDialog.Root>
		<AlertDialog.Trigger>
			<Button variant="soft">Size 4</Button>
		</AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<AlertDialog.Content __size__="4">
			<Text as="p" trim="both" size="4">
				The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
			</Text>
		</AlertDialog.Content>
	</AlertDialog.Root>
</Flex>
```

### With inset content

Use the [Inset](/themes/docs/components/inset) component to align content flush with the sides of the dialog.

```jsx live=true
<AlertDialog.Root>
	<AlertDialog.Trigger>
		<Button color="red">Delete users</Button>
	</AlertDialog.Trigger>
	<AlertDialog.Content maxWidth="500px">
		<AlertDialog.Title>Delete Users</AlertDialog.Title>
		<AlertDialog.Description size="2">
			Are you sure you want to delete these users? This action is permanent and
			cannot be undone.
		</AlertDialog.Description>

		<Inset side="x" my="5">
			<Table.Root>
				<Table.Header>
					<Table.Row>
						<Table.ColumnHeaderCell>Full name</Table.ColumnHeaderCell>
						<Table.ColumnHeaderCell>Email</Table.ColumnHeaderCell>
						<Table.ColumnHeaderCell>Group</Table.ColumnHeaderCell>
					</Table.Row>
				</Table.Header>

				<Table.Body>
					<Table.Row>
						<Table.RowHeaderCell>Danilo Sousa</Table.RowHeaderCell>
						<Table.Cell>danilo@example.com</Table.Cell>
						<Table.Cell>Developer</Table.Cell>
					</Table.Row>

					<Table.Row>
						<Table.RowHeaderCell>Zahra Ambessa</Table.RowHeaderCell>
						<Table.Cell>zahra@example.com</Table.Cell>
						<Table.Cell>Admin</Table.Cell>
					</Table.Row>
				</Table.Body>
			</Table.Root>
		</Inset>

		<Flex gap="3" justify="end">
			<AlertDialog.Cancel>
				<Button variant="soft" color="gray">
					Cancel
				</Button>
			</AlertDialog.Cancel>
			<AlertDialog.Action>
				<Button color="red">Delete users</Button>
			</AlertDialog.Action>
		</Flex>
	</AlertDialog.Content>
</AlertDialog.Root>
```

## Aspect Ratio

Displays content within a desired ratio.

```jsx live=true

---

## Button

Trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form or displaying a dialog.

```jsx live=true
<Button>
	<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
</Button>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `button` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the button.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Button size="1" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button size="2" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button size="3" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style of the button.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex align="center" gap="3">
	<Button variant="classic">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="solid">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="soft">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="surface">Edit profile</Button>
	<Button variant="outline">Edit profile</Button>
</Flex>
```

#### Ghost

Use the `ghost` variant to display a button without chrome. Ghost buttons behave like text in layout, as they use a negative margin to optically align themselves against their siblings while maintaining the padding in active and hover states.

```jsx live=true
<Button variant="ghost">Edit profile</Button>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button color="indigo" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button color="cyan" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button color="orange" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button color="crimson" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

	<Flex gap="3">
		<Button color="gray" variant="classic">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="solid">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="soft">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="surface">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="outline">
			Edit profile
		</Button>
	</Flex>
	<Flex gap="3">
		<Button color="gray" variant="classic" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="solid" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="soft" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="surface" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
		<Button color="gray" variant="outline" highContrast>
			Edit profile
		</Button>
	</Flex>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button radius="none" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button radius="large" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
	<Button radius="full" variant="soft">
		Edit profile
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### With icons

You can nest icons directly inside the button. An appropriate gap is provided automatically.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button variant="classic">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="solid">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="soft">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="surface">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button variant="outline">
		<BookmarkIcon /> Bookmark
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

### Loading

Use the `loading` prop to display a loading spinner in place of button content, preserving the original size of the button in its normal state. The button will be disabled while loading.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button loading variant="classic">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="solid">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="soft">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="surface">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button loading variant="outline">
		Bookmark
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

If you have an icon inside the button, you can use the button’s `disabled` state and wrap the icon in a standalone [Spinner](/themes/docs/components/spinner) to achieve a more sophisticated design.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Button disabled variant="classic">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="solid">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="soft">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="surface">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="outline">
		<Spinner loading>
			<BookmarkIcon />
		</Spinner>
		Bookmark
	</Button>
</Flex>
```

Add a native [WAI-ARIA `alert` role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role) to the callout when the user’s immediate attention is required, like when an error message appears. The screen reader will be interrupted, announcing the new content immediately.

```jsx live=true
<Callout.Root color="red" role="alert">
	<Callout.Icon>
		<ExclamationTriangleIcon />
	</Callout.Icon>
	<Callout.Text>
		Access denied. Please contact the network administrator to view this page.
	</Callout.Text>
</Callout.Root>

			Start building your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Card>
</Flex>
```

### With inset content

```jsx live=true
<Box maxWidth="240px">
	<Card size="2">
		<Inset clip="padding-box" side="top" pb="current">
			<img
				src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1617050318658-a9a3175e34cb?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=80"

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<CheckboxGroup.Root size="1" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="2">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="2">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root size="2" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="3">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="3">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>

	<CheckboxGroup.Root size="3" defaultValue="1">
		<Text as="label" size="4">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="1" /> Default
			</Flex>
		</Text>

		<Text as="label" size="4">
			<Flex gap="2">
				<CheckboxGroup.Item value="2" /> Compact
			</Flex>
		</Text>
	</CheckboxGroup.Root>
</Flex>
```

It is automatically well-aligned with multi-line text too.

### Disabled

		<Flex as="span" gap="2">
			<Checkbox disabled defaultChecked />
			Checked
		</Flex>
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="200px">
	<Code truncate>linear-gradient(red, orange, yellow, green, blue);</Code>
</Flex>
```

	<DecorativeBox />
	<DecorativeBox />
</Grid>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `div` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

Use these props to create grid layouts.

The following props are shared between [Box](./box), [Flex](./flex), [Grid](./grid), [Container](./container) and [Section](./section) components. Read more about layout components in [Layout](/themes/docs/overview/layout).

<Grid columns={{ initial: "1", md: "2" }} gap="3" width="auto">
	<Box height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
	<Box height="64px">
		<DecorativeBox />
	</Box>
</Grid>
```

---

## Heading

Semantic heading element.

```jsx live=true
<Heading>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `h1` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### As another element

Use the `as` prop to change the heading level. This prop is purely semantic and does not change the visual appearance.

```jsx live=true
<Heading as="h1">Level 1</Heading>
<Heading as="h2">Level 2</Heading>
<Heading as="h3">Level 3</Heading>
```

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the heading. The prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Heading size="1">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="2">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="3">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="4">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="5">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="7">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="8">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading size="9">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Heading weight="regular">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Heading>

<Heading weight="medium">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Heading>

<Heading weight="bold">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Heading>
```

### Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```jsx live=true
<Heading align="left">Left-aligned</Heading>
<Heading align="center">Center-aligned</Heading>
<Heading align="right">Right-aligned</Heading>
```

### Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.

The prop works similarly to the upcoming [half-leading control](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#leading-trim) spec, but uses a common [negative margin workaround](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) under the hood for cross-browser support.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Heading
		trim="normal"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		Without trim
	</Heading>
	<Heading
		trim="both"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		With trim
	</Heading>
</Flex>
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Box
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
		p="4"
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3">
			Without trim
		</Heading>
		<Text>
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>

	<Box
		p="4"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3" trim="start">
			With trim
		</Heading>
		<Text trim="end">
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

The default trim values are configured for the system font stack that’s used by Radix Themes. If you are using custom fonts, you can [adjust](/themes/docs/theme/typography#customization) the trim values using the corresponding CSS variables.

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--default-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
}
```

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading truncate>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### Wrap

Use the `wrap` prop to control text wrapping.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading wrap="nowrap">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading wrap="balance">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Heading wrap="pretty">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color). The text colors are designed to achieve at least Lc 60 APCA contrast over common background colors.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column">
	<Heading color="indigo">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading color="cyan">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading color="orange">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
	<Heading color="crimson">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column">
	<Heading color="gray">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Heading>
	<Heading color="gray" highContrast>
		The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	</Heading>
</Flex>
```

## Icon Button

Button designed specifically for usage with a single icon.

```jsx live=true
<IconButton>
	<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
</IconButton>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `button` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the button.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="3">
	<IconButton size="1" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="15" height="15" />
	</IconButton>

	<IconButton size="2" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>

	<IconButton size="3" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="22" height="22" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style of the button.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3">

	<IconButton variant="outline">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

#### Ghost

Use the `ghost` variant to display a button without chrome. Ghost buttons behave like text in layout, as they use a negative margin to optically align themselves against their siblings while maintaining the padding in active and hover states.

```jsx live=true
<IconButton variant="ghost">
	<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
</IconButton>
```

### Color

	<IconButton radius="full" variant="soft">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
</Flex>
```

### Loading

Use the `loading` prop to display a loading spinner in place of button content. The button will be disabled while loading.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<IconButton loading variant="classic">
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon width="18" height="18" />
	</IconButton>
	<IconButton loading variant="solid">

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the [Popover primitive](/primitives/docs/components/popover).

### Root

Contains all the parts of a popover.

### Trigger

Wraps the control that will open the popover.

### Content

Contains content to be rendered in the open popover. This component is based on the `div` element.

```jsx live=true
<Popover.Root>
	<Popover.Trigger>
		<Button variant="soft">
			<Share2Icon width="16" height="16" />
			Share image
		</Button>
	</Popover.Trigger>

## Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

## API Reference

---

## Progress

Displays a progress bar related to a task.

```jsx live=true
<Box maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress />
</Box>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the [Progress primitive](/primitives/docs/components/progress) and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={25} size="1" />
	<Progress value={50} size="2" />
	<Progress value={75} size="3" />
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={25} variant="classic" />
	<Progress value={50} variant="surface" />
	<Progress value={75} variant="soft" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={20} color="indigo" />
	<Progress value={40} color="cyan" />
	<Progress value={60} color="orange" />
	<Progress value={80} color="crimson" />
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns="2" gap="4">
	<Progress value={10} color="indigo" />
	<Progress value={10} color="indigo" highContrast />
	<Progress value={30} color="cyan" />
	<Progress value={30} color="cyan" highContrast />
	<Progress value={50} color="orange" />
	<Progress value={50} color="orange" highContrast />
	<Progress value={70} color="crimson" />
	<Progress value={70} color="crimson" highContrast />
	<Progress value={90} color="gray" />
	<Progress value={90} color="gray" highContrast />
</Grid>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="4" maxWidth="300px">
	<Progress value={25} radius="none" />
	<Progress value={50} radius="small" />
	<Progress value={75} radius="full" />
</Flex>
```

### With controlled value

Use the `value` prop to provide a precise indication of the task progress.

```jsx live=true
<Progress value={75} />
```

### With custom duration

Use the `duration` prop to indicate an approximate duration of an indeterminate task. Once the duration times out, the progress bar will start an indeterminate animation.

```jsx live=true
<Progress duration="30s" />
```

When an approximate duration can be estimated, the Progress component is still useful over [Spinner](./spinner), which doesn’t provide any visual cues towards the progress of the task.

---

## Quote

Short inline quotation.

```jsx live=true
<Text>
	His famous quote,{" "}
	<Quote>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style</Quote>,

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Quote truncate>
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Quote>
</Flex>
```

It renders a [Slot primitive](/primitives/docs/utilities/slot) that:

- Accepts a single React element as its child
- Removes opinionated browser styles
- Sets idiomatic layout defaults, like `display: block` for images or `width: stretch` for inputs
- Sets the [cursor](/themes/docs/theme/cursors) style according to your theme settings
- Adds `box-sizing: border-box`

## Scroll Area

Custom-styled scrollable area using native functionality.

```jsx live=true
<ScrollArea type="always" scrollbars="vertical" style={{ height: 180 }}>
	<Box p="2" pr="8">
		<Heading size="4" mb="2" trim="start">
			Principles of the typographic craft
		</Heading>
		<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
			<Text as="p">
				Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
				aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and “readable”
				are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
				related concepts.
			</Text>

			<Text as="p">
				Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
				distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the
				quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance, if a “b”
				and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to distinguish at small
				sizes, this is a problem of legibility.
			</Text>

			<Text as="p">
				Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to
				select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font
				containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The
				selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using
				only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.
			</Text>
		</Flex>
	</Box>
</ScrollArea>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the ScrollArea primitive [Root](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#root) and [Viewport](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#viewport) parts. It supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the scrollbar handles.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
	<ScrollArea
		size="1"
		type="always"
		scrollbars="horizontal"
		style={{ width: 300, height: 12 }}
	>
		<Box width="800px" height="1px" />
	</ScrollArea>

	<ScrollArea
		size="2"
		type="always"
		scrollbars="horizontal"
		style={{ width: 350, height: 16 }}
	>
		<Box width="900px" height="1px" />
	</ScrollArea>

	<ScrollArea
		size="3"
		type="always"
		scrollbars="horizontal"
		style={{ width: 400, height: 20 }}
	>
		<Box width="1000px" height="1px" />
	</ScrollArea>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius to the handles.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<ScrollArea
		radius="none"
		type="always"
		scrollbars="horizontal"
		style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
	>
		<Box width="800px" height="1px" />
	</ScrollArea>

	<ScrollArea
		radius="full"
		type="always"
		scrollbars="horizontal"
		style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
	>
		<Box width="800px" height="1px" />
	</ScrollArea>
</Flex>
```

### Scrollbars

Use the `scrollbars` prop to limit scrollable axes.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns="2" gap="2">
	<ScrollArea type="always" scrollbars="vertical" style={{ height: 150 }}>
		<Flex p="2" pr="8" direction="column" gap="4">
			<Text size="2" trim="both">
				Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
				aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
				are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
				related concepts.
			</Text>

			<Text size="2" trim="both">
				Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
				distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as "the
				quality of being decipherable and recognisable". For instance, if a "b"
				and an "h", or a "3" and an "8", are difficult to distinguish at small
				sizes, this is a problem of legibility.
			</Text>
		</Flex>
	</ScrollArea>

	<ScrollArea type="always" scrollbars="horizontal" style={{ height: 150 }}>
		<Flex gap="4" p="2" width="700px">
			<Text size="2" trim="both">
				Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
				aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
				are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
				related concepts.
			</Text>

			<Text size="2" trim="both">
				Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
				distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as "the
				quality of being decipherable and recognisable". For instance, if a "b"
				and an "h", or a "3" and an "8", are difficult to distinguish at small

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Select.Root size="1" defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root size="2" defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root size="3" defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop on `Trigger` and `Content` to customize the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="surface" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="classic" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

#### Ghost

Use the `ghost` trigger variant to render the trigger without a visually containing element. Ghost triggers behave differently in layout as they use a negative margin to optically align themselves against their siblings while maintaining their padded active and hover states.

```jsx live=true line=11
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="surface" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger variant="ghost" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop on `Trigger` and `Content` to assign a specific color value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="indigo" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="indigo">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="cyan" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="cyan">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="orange" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="orange">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="crimson" variant="soft" />
		<Select.Content color="crimson">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop on `Content` to increase item contrast.

```jsx live=true line=12
<Flex gap="3">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="gray" />
		<Select.Content color="gray" variant="solid">
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger color="gray" />
		<Select.Content color="gray" variant="solid" highContrast>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3">
	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger radius="none" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger radius="large" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>

	<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
		<Select.Trigger radius="full" />
		<Select.Content>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
		</Select.Content>
	</Select.Root>
</Flex>
```

### Placeholder

Use the `placeholder` prop to create a `Trigger` that doesn’t need an initial value.

```jsx live="true"
<Select.Root>
	<Select.Trigger placeholder="Pick a fruit" />
	<Select.Content>
		<Select.Group>
			<Select.Label>Fruits</Select.Label>
			<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="grape" disabled>
				Grape
			</Select.Item>
		</Select.Group>
		<Select.Separator />
		<Select.Group>
			<Select.Label>Vegetables</Select.Label>
			<Select.Item value="carrot">Carrot</Select.Item>
			<Select.Item value="potato">Potato</Select.Item>
		</Select.Group>
	</Select.Content>
</Select.Root>
```

### Position

Set `position="popper"` prop to position the select menu below the trigger.

```jsx live=true
<Select.Root defaultValue="apple">
	<Select.Trigger />
	<Select.Content position="popper">
		<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
		<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
	</Select.Content>
</Select.Root>
```

### With SSR

When using server-side rendering, you might notice a layout shift after hydration. This is because Trigger executes client-side code to display the selected item’s text. To avoid that layout shift, you can render it manually by mapping values.

```jsx live=true
() => {
	const data = {
		apple: "Apple",
		orange: "Orange",
	};
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("apple");
	return (
		<Select.Root value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
			<Select.Trigger>{data[value]}</Select.Trigger>
			<Select.Content>
				<Select.Item value="apple">Apple</Select.Item>
				<Select.Item value="orange">Orange</Select.Item>
			</Select.Content>
		</Select.Root>
	);
};
```

### With an icon

You can customise how Trigger renders the value by controlling its children manually. For example, you can render an icon next to the selected item’s text.

```jsx live=true
() => {
	const data = {
		light: { label: "Light", icon: <SunIcon /> },
		dark: { label: "Dark", icon: <MoonIcon /> },
	};
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState("light");
	return (
		<Flex direction="column" maxWidth="160px">
			<Select.Root value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
				<Select.Trigger>
					<Flex as="span" align="center" gap="2">
						{data[value].icon}
						{data[value].label}
					</Flex>
				</Select.Trigger>
				<Select.Content position="popper">
					<Select.Item value="light">Light</Select.Item>
					<Select.Item value="dark">Dark</Select.Item>
				</Select.Content>
			</Select.Root>
		</Flex>
	);
};
```

---

## Separator

Visually or semantically separates content.

```jsx live=true
<Text size="2">
	Tools for building high-quality, accessible UI.
	<Separator my="3" size="4" />
	<Flex gap="3" align="center">
		Themes
		<Separator orientation="vertical" />
		Primitives
		<Separator orientation="vertical" />
		Icons
		<Separator orientation="vertical" />
		Colors
	</Flex>
</Text>
```

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the [Separator primitive](/primitives/docs/components/separator) and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the separator. The largest step takes full width or height of the container.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="1" />
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="2" />
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="3" />
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" size="4" />
</Flex>
```

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4" height="96px">
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="1" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="2" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="3" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" size="4" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Separator color="indigo" size="4" />
	<Separator color="cyan" size="4" />
	<Separator color="orange" size="4" />
	<Separator color="crimson" size="4" />
</Flex>
```

### Orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to control whether the separator is horizontal or vertical.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4">
	<Separator orientation="horizontal" />
	<Separator orientation="vertical" />
</Flex>
```

---

## Skeleton

Replaces content with same shape placeholder that indicates a loading state.

```jsx live="true"
<Skeleton>Loading</Skeleton>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `span` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the width and height props to manually control the size of the skeleton.

```jsx live="true"
<Skeleton width="48px" height="48px" />
```

### With children

Use the `loading` prop to control whether the skeleton or its children are displayed. Skeleton preserves the dimensions of children when they are hidden and disables interactive elements.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex gap="4">
	<Skeleton loading={true}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Skeleton>

	<Skeleton loading={false}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Skeleton>
</Flex>
```

### With text

When using Skeleton with text, you’d usually wrap the text node itself rather than the parent element. This ensures that the text is replaced with a placeholder of the same size:

```jsx live="true" line="4,7,9"
<Container size="1">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
		<Text>
			<Skeleton>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</Skeleton>
		</Text>

		<Skeleton>
			<Text>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</Text>
		</Skeleton>
	</Flex>
</Container>
```

The difference is especially noticeable when wrapping longer paragraphs:

```jsx live="true" line="4,8,11,17"
<Container size="1">
	<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
		<Text>
			<Skeleton>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque
				felis tellus, efficitur id convallis a, viverra eget libero. Nam magna
				erat, fringilla sed commodo sed, aliquet nec magna.
			</Skeleton>
		</Text>

		<Skeleton>
			<Text>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque
				felis tellus, efficitur id convallis a, viverra eget libero. Nam magna
				erat, fringilla sed commodo sed, aliquet nec magna.
			</Text>
		</Skeleton>
	</Flex>
</Container>
```

<Flex align="center" gap="4">
	<Spinner size="1" />
	<Spinner size="2" />
	<Spinner size="3" />
</Flex>
```

### With children

Use the `loading` prop to control whether the spinner or its children are displayed. Spinner preserves the dimensions of children when they are hidden and disables interactive elements.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex gap="4">
	<Spinner loading={true}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Spinner>

	<Spinner loading={false}>
		<Switch defaultChecked />
	</Spinner>
</Flex>
```

### With buttons

[Buttons](/themes/docs/components/button) have their own `loading` prop that automatically composes a spinner.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Button loading>Bookmark</Button>
```

If you have an icon inside the button, you can use the button’s `disabled` state and wrap the icon in a standalone `<Spinner>` to achieve a more sophisticated design.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Button disabled>
	<Spinner loading>
		<BookmarkIcon />
	</Spinner>
	Bookmark
</Button>
```

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the switch.

```jsx live=true
<Flex align="center" gap="2">
	<Switch size="1" defaultChecked />
	<Switch size="2" defaultChecked />

## API Reference

### Root

Groups the `Header` and `Body` parts. This component is based on the `table` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

### Header

Contains the column headings for the table, based on the `thead` element.

### Body

Displays the table data. This component is based on the `tbody` element.

### Row

A row of table cells. Based on the `tr` element.

### Cell

A basic table cell. This component is based on the `td` element, but uses `justify` instead of `align` to control how horizontal space is distributed within the table cell.

### ColumnHeaderCell

The header of a table column. Based on the `th` element and provides the same props interface as the `Cell` part.

### RowHeaderCell

The header of a table row. Based on the `th` element and provides the same props interface as the `Cell` part.

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control how large the text and padding of the table cells should be.

```jsx live=true line=2,22,42
<Flex direction="column" gap="5" maxWidth="350px">

## Text Area

Captures multi-line user input.

```jsx live=true
<TextArea placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `textarea` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Box maxWidth="200px">
		<TextArea size="1" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
	</Box>
	<Box maxWidth="250px">
		<TextArea size="2" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />

	<TextArea variant="surface" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
	<TextArea variant="classic" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
	<TextArea variant="soft" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="250px">
	<TextArea color="blue" variant="soft" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
	<TextArea color="green" variant="soft" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />
	<TextArea color="red" variant="soft" placeholder="Reply to comment…" />

	<TextArea resize="horizontal" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextArea resize="both" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

---

## Text Field

Captures user input with an optional slot for buttons and icons.

```jsx live=true
<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…">
	<TextField.Slot>
		<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
	</TextField.Slot>
</TextField.Root>
```

## API Reference

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Box maxWidth="200px">
		<TextField.Root size="1" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	</Box>
	<Box maxWidth="250px">
		<TextField.Root size="2" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	</Box>
	<Box maxWidth="300px">
		<TextField.Root size="3" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

Use matching component sizes when composing Text Field with buttons. However, don’t use size 1 inputs with buttons—at this size, there is not enough vertical space to nest other interactive elements.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="400px">
	<Box maxWidth="200px">
		<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…" size="1">
			<TextField.Slot>
				<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
			</TextField.Slot>
		</TextField.Root>
	</Box>

	<Box maxWidth="250px">
		<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…" size="2">
			<TextField.Slot>
				<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
			</TextField.Slot>
			<TextField.Slot>
				<IconButton size="1" variant="ghost">
					<DotsHorizontalIcon height="14" width="14" />
				</IconButton>
			</TextField.Slot>
		</TextField.Root>
	</Box>

	<Box maxWidth="300px">
		<TextField.Root placeholder="Search the docs…" size="3">
			<TextField.Slot>
				<MagnifyingGlassIcon height="16" width="16" />
			</TextField.Slot>
			<TextField.Slot pr="3">
				<IconButton size="2" variant="ghost">
					<DotsHorizontalIcon height="16" width="16" />
				</IconButton>
			</TextField.Slot>
		</TextField.Root>
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

### Variant

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="250px">
	<TextField.Root variant="surface" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root variant="classic" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root variant="soft" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color).

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3" maxWidth="250px">
	<TextField.Root
		color="indigo"
		variant="soft"
		placeholder="Search the docs…"
	/>
	<TextField.Root color="green" variant="soft" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
	<TextField.Root color="red" variant="soft" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

	<TextField.Root radius="full" placeholder="Search the docs…" />
</Flex>
```

---

## Text

Foundational text primitive.

```jsx live=true
<Text>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `span` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### As another element

Use the `as` prop to render text as a `p`, `label`, `div` or `span`. This prop is purely semantic and does not alter visual appearance.

```jsx live=true
<Text as="p">This is a <Strong>paragraph</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="label">This is a <Strong>label</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="div">This is a <Strong>div</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="span">This is a <Strong>span</Strong> element.</Text>
```

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Text size="1">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="2">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="3">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="4">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="5">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="7">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="8">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text size="9">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
</Flex>
```

Sizes 2–4 are designed to work well for long-form content.

```jsx live=true
<Text as="p" mb="5" size="4">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
</Text>

<Text as="p" mb="5" size="3">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
</Text>

<Text as="p" size="2" color="gray">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
</Text>
```

Sizes 1–3 are designed to work well for UI labels.

```jsx live=true
<Grid align="center" columns="2" gap="5" p="3">
	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="3" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="2">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="2" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="2">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="2" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="1">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>

	<Flex direction="column">
		<Text size="1" weight="bold">
			Get started
		</Text>
		<Text color="gray" size="1">
			Start your next project in minutes
		</Text>
	</Flex>
</Grid>
```

### Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Text weight="regular" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>

<Text weight="medium" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>

<Text weight="bold" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>
```

### Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```jsx live=true
<Text align="left" as="div">Left-aligned</Text>
<Text align="center" as="div">Center-aligned</Text>
<Text align="right" as="div">Right-aligned</Text>
```

### Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.

The prop works similarly to the upcoming [half-leading control](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#leading-trim) spec, but uses a common [negative margin workaround](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) under the hood for cross-browser support.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Text
		trim="normal"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		Without trim
	</Text>
	<Text
		trim="both"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		With trim
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
	<Box
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
		p="4"
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3">
			Without trim
		</Heading>
		<Text>
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>

	<Box
		p="4"
		style={{
			background: "var(--gray-a2)",
			border: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>
		<Heading mb="1" size="3" trim="start">
			With trim
		</Heading>
		<Text trim="end">
			The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
			in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
			more pleasant.
		</Text>
	</Box>
</Flex>
```

The default trim values are configured for the system font stack that’s used by Radix Themes. If you are using custom fonts, you can [adjust](/themes/docs/theme/typography#customization) the trim values using the corresponding CSS variables.

```css
.radix-themes {
	--default-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--default-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
}
```

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Text truncate>
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

### Wrap

Use the `wrap` prop to control text wrapping.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
	<Text wrap="nowrap">
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
	<Text wrap="balance">
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
	<Text wrap="pretty">
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](/themes/docs/theme/color). The text colors are designed to achieve at least Lc 60 APCA contrast over common background colors.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column">
	<Text color="indigo">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="cyan">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="orange">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="crimson">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column">
	<Text color="gray">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
	<Text color="gray" highContrast>
		The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	</Text>
</Flex>
```

### With formatting

Compose `Text` with formatting components to add emphasis and structure to content.

```jsx live="true"
<Text as="p">
	Look, such a helpful <Link href="#">link</Link>, an <Em>italic emphasis</Em>,
	a piece of computer <Code>code</Code>, and even a hotkey combination{" "}
	<Kbd>⇧⌘A</Kbd> within the text.
</Text>
```

### With form controls

Composing `Text` with a form control like [`Checkbox`](/themes/docs/components/checkbox), [`RadioGroup`](/themes/docs/components/radio-group), or [`Switch`](/themes/docs/components/switch) automatically centers the control with the first line of text, even when the text is multi-line.

```jsx live="true"
<Box maxWidth="300px">
	<Text as="label" size="3">
		<Flex gap="2">
			<Checkbox defaultChecked /> I understand that these documents are
			confidential and cannot be shared with a third party.
		</Flex>
	</Text>
</Box>
```

## Theme

Wraps all or part of a React tree to provide theme configuration.

## API Reference

For an overview of theming see the [overview page](/themes/docs/theme/overview).

## Examples

### Basic configuration

Wrap a component tree in the `Theme` component to provide or modify configuration for all children.

```jsx live=true
<Box maxWidth="400px">
	<Card size="2">
		<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
			<Grid gap="1">
				<Text as="div" weight="bold" size="2" mb="1">
					Feedback
				</Text>
				<TextArea placeholder="Write your feedback…" />
			</Grid>
			<Flex asChild justify="between">
				<label>
					<Text color="gray" size="2">
