**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

Initially, we are using it to create the company's website. We’re also creating our components using Stitches.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

The development time decreased absurdly, for the better. We have the assurance that the components created are fully-accessible and are tested thoroughly.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The clean and robust documentation{'\u2060'}—with good examples of how to use the component APIs is what the team likes most. Compared to other libraries, the documentation is incredible, and answers all the day-to-day questions.

**How has Stitches improved your developer experience and/or app performance?**

With Stitches, the use of tokens and variants makes it extremely easy to build robust components. Consequently the speed of delivery is much higher.
