# Acid Tango

<HeroQuote>
  Thanks to Radix, we have been able to focus on the product and our clients’
  needs instead of worrying about implementation details. Before Radix, we had
  to build everything from scratch. Now it “just works”.

**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

We are a team of 9 developers working on four different design systems for various projects. Some of those projects started recently, but others have been around for more than a year. Each project has 2 or 3 developers working on them.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

Thanks to Radix, we have been able to focus on the product and our clients’ needs instead of worrying about implementation details. The components are accessible and well-documented. You can style every detail, so despite the fact that we have used them in four different projects, none of them look the same.

Before Radix, we had to build everything from scratch. For a Dialog we had to take care of the focus lock, scroll lock, etc. Now it “just works”.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

It allows us to get started straightforwardly. The examples included in the documentation provide detailed and thorough information.

The aspect we like the most about using Radix is that it gives you all the necessary bits and pieces to build a component, and you can compose them as you want or create more abstractions on top of them.

Also, they are effortless to style, no matter the styling solution you use. We are using CSS Modules in some projects and Stitches in others. No need to override styles, no specificity wars.

We have four different projects using Radix, and we’re yet to face a problem we can’t solve with the props available.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The documentation is one of the best we have ever seen. The API reference is extensive, and every component has real-world examples with custom styles, animations, etc. One of our favorite parts is the accessibility section, as not many libraries document that.

**How has Stitches improved your developer experience and/or app performance?**

We have been using Stitches for almost a year now. It was a breath of fresh air. The amount of code we had to write was significantly reduced since we did not have to type the variants or transform props to class names manually. Adding theming or dark mode is as easy as it gets. So far, we have used CSS modules, styled-components, and Emotion (with styled-system), and we are not looking back.
