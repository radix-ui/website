  Radix has helped us with faster development, and better quality of the end
  product. It was super easy to get started – the configuration and defaults are
  great.

**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

We’ve used it for [Livepeer](https://livepeer.com/dashboard) design system, but we mainly use it for websites – [Akash](https://akash.network), [Lettermatic](https://lettermatic.com), and others coming up. 1-2 devs per project.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

Radix has helped us with faster development, and better quality of the end product. The components that Radix provides are super hard to build from the ground up. Our DX and speed have improved a lot with Radix – we use it as much as we can – Dropdowns, Tooltip, Tabs, Aspect Ratio, etc.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

I love Radix APIs. It was super easy to get started – the configuration and defaults are great. I have nothing to complain/improve off the top of my head.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The docs are amazing. One of the best docs I’ve ever used. Versioned, well explained, demos, and CodeSandboxes!

**How has Stitches improved your developer experience and/or app performance?**

We love the flexibility Stitches has. It provides the full power of CSS, and can be used inline or with a more organized approach. We've been enjoying the Framework Agnostic API a lot, as it lets us use native HTML elements. Amazing stuff.
