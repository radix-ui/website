**Describe the type of project you are using Radix Primitives on?**

The Liveblocks design system relies on Radix Primitives, Tailwind CSS, and React. It is structured in a way that enables us to use primitives such as colors, fonts, and shadows and a selected set of components on our marketing site, documentation site, and product dashboard.

Since everything runs on Next.js, this allows us to keep things on brand across different platforms, while still giving us the freedom to create platform-specific UI patterns. I originally designed and set up the system, but it’s now maintained and improved by the Design Engineers on our team.

**In what ways have Radix Primitives helped you and your company?**

At a previous company, I designed and built a custom menu component. That’s when I learned how difficult and time consuming it was to create something that looked and behaved like a native macOS menu. Menu items can be infinitely nested, screen real-estate has to be taken into consideration, typing needs to automatically select the first item that matches, and the list goes on…

Radix Primitives handle all that stuff incredibly well. With Radix Primitives, we’re able to create a high-quality custom UI that behaves like native elements—without spending weeks on it. Instead, we can spend that time on our core product. As it stands today, we use Radix Primitives for our Dialog, Alert Dialog, Menu, Context Menu, Scroll Area, and Tooltip. Marc Bouchenoire on our team also recently converted our website main navigation to use NavigationMenu as well to improve accessibility.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

I like that we can only install the components we need into our code base. This made it easy for us to convert things over one component at a time. But what I really like most is that components come completely unstyled which enables us to compose things the way we want, and even use Tailwind CSS to style things.

<br />

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The documentation is great. The examples make it very easy to understand how things work. I also looked at Modulz design system to see how you were using Radix on your side and definitely took a lot of inspiration from that.
