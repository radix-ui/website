Initially, we are using it to create the company's website. We’re also creating our components using Stitches.

<br />

The development time decreased absurdly, for the better. We have the assurance that the components created are fully-accessible and are tested thoroughly.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The clean and robust documentation{'\u2060'}—with good examples of how to use the component APIs is what the team likes most. Compared to other libraries, the documentation is incredible, and answers all the day-to-day questions.
