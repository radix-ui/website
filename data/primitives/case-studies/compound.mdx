**Describe the type of project you are using Radix Primitives on?**

At Compound, we use Radix Primitives to power our design system. This design system is leveraged throughout our client-facing application.

<br />

**In what ways have Radix Primitives helped you and your company?**

Radix Primitives allow us to focus on our product and clients’ needs instead of minute implementation details and other concepts like component accessibility. The speed and confidence factor to get features out the door were reasons we adopted Radix Primitives.

<br />

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

The DX is top notch. We really like the ease with which you can add, enter, and exit animations relying purely on data attributes. The API is consistent and extremely flexible which allows us to create our own abstractions on top of Radix Primitives.

<br />

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The docs are well written and the UI is beautiful. I personally really like the fact that each component has a real-world example which helps illustrate how the component works even better.
