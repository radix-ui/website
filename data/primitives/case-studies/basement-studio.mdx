**Describe the type of project you are using Radix Primitives on?**

We’ve used it for [Livepeer](https://livepeer.com/dashboard) design system, but we mainly use it for websites{'\u2060'}—[Akash](https://akash.network), [Lettermatic](https://lettermatic.com), and others coming up. 1-2 devs per project.

<br />

**In what ways have Radix Primitives helped you and your company?**

Radix Primitives have helped us with faster development, and better quality of the end product. The components that Radix provides are super hard to build from the ground up. Our DX and speed have improved a lot with Radix{'\u2060'}—we use it as much as we can{'\u2060'}—Dropdowns, Tooltip, Tabs, Aspect Ratio, etc.

<br />

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

I love Radix APIs. It was super easy to get started{'\u2060'}—the configuration and defaults are great. I have nothing to complain/improve off the top of my head.

<br />

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The docs are amazing. One of the best docs I’ve ever used. Versioned, well explained, demos, and CodeSandboxes!
