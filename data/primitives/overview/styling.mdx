# Styling

<Description>
  Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving
  you complete control over styling.
</Description>

## Styling overview

### Functional styles

You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a [Dialog Overlay](../components/dialog) won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.

### Classes

All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/dialog) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.

## Styling with CSS

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targeting the `className` that you provide. The primitives can be wrapped to add your class.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  React.ComponentProps<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>((props, forwardedRef) => {
  const { className, ...itemProps } = props;
  return (
    <AccordionPrimitive.Item
      {...itemProps}
      ref={forwardedRef}
      className={'accordion-item ' + className}
    />
  );
});
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```css
.accordion-item {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.accordion-item[data-state='open'] {
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

## Styling with CSS-in-JS

The examples below are using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by wrapping it in a `styled` function (or equivalent).

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',
});

const StyledPanel = styled(Accordion.Panel, {
  padding: 10,
});
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',

  '&[data-state=open]': {
    borderBottomWidth: '2px',
  },
});
```

### Demo

Here's an example of how you can style the [Accordion](../components/accordion) component with CSS-in-JS.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledAccordion = styled(Accordion.Root, {});
const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {});
const StyledHeader = styled(Accordion.Header, {});
const StyledTrigger = styled(Accordion.Trigger, {});
const StyledPanel = styled(Accordion.Content, {});

export default () => {
  return (
    <StyledAccordion type="single">
      <StyledItem value="item-1">
        <StyledHeader>
          <StyledTrigger>Trigger text</StyledTrigger>
        </StyledHeader>
        <StyledPanel>Panel content</StyledPanel>
      </StyledItem>
    </StyledAccordion>
  );
};
```

## Extending a primitive

Extending a primitive is done the same way you extend any React component. One minor difference is the use of `Radix.ComponentPropsWithoutRef` instead of `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef` which is just a workaround until [the fixed types are released](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/55396).

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
import type * as Radix from '@radix-ui/react-primitive';

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  Radix.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>((props, forwardedRef) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));
AccordionItem.displayName = 'AccordionItem';
```

## Changing the rendered element

All component parts that render a DOM element have an `asChild` prop. This is useful when you want a part to attach its accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element instead.

If you decide to change the underlying node rendered by Radix (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it is up to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.

Here's an example of how you can use a custom `Button` as the trigger for a `Dialog.Trigger`:

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';

// This is a generic button, eg: from your design system
const Button = styled('button', {...});

export default () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root>
      <Dialog.Trigger __asChild__>
        <Button>Open dialog</Button>
      </Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Content>...</Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  );
};
```

## Summary

Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.

For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.
