## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install, style, and export a [Popover](../components/popover) component. This example uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but any styling solution is compatible.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover@latest -E
```

### 2. Style each part

Import and export the parts. Add styles where desired.

```jsx
// Popover.tsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

export const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
export const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
export const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {
  // your styles
});
```

### 3. Use it

Import each of the component parts into your app, then assemble your Popover.

```jsx
// App.tsx
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverContent,
} from 'your-components/Popover';

function App() {
  return (
    <Popover>
      <PopoverTrigger>...</PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>...</PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

### Demo

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.
