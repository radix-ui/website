# Balance

<Description>Balance</Description>

## Lightness test

There are three categories of color: grays, colors, and bright colors. Within each section, all hues should be balanced across any given step. The colors are displayed in grayscale so we can focus on the lightness without being distracted by saturation.

<Note>
  **Note:** Some discrepancy is fine here—desired, even. Different
  hues naturally have different levels of chromatic intensity.
  Although it's good to keep hues balanced across, preserving some of
  the natural brightness curve can help the overall palette feel more
  natural.
