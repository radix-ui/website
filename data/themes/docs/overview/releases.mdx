- General
  - Combine selectors in the CSS build, improving the developer experience when inspecting elements in the browser.
  - Remove comments from the CSS build.
  - Cap CSS selector specificity at `0,1,0` for styling HTML elements and at `0,1,1` for styling pseudo-elements, improving compatibility with Tailwind.
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were relying on any specificity quirks of Radix Themes, make sure that your style overrides still work as expected.
  - Rework dark mode colors, refine light mode colors (via Radix Colors 3.0.0).
    - Fix oversaturated transparent grays.
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were using the color tokens for your custom styles, make sure that your designs look as expected.
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were overriding certain colors, make sure that your overrides are harmonized with the new color scales.
  - Rework transparent black and white color scales.
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were using transparent black and white color scales for your custom styles (`--black-a1`, `--white-a1`, etc.), make sure to check the new values and update the steps used so that your designs look as expected:
      - Change `--black-a1` to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.01)`

  - Refine the shadow scale.
  - Maintain theme accent color for focus rings on most `color="gray"` component, similarly to the text selection color.
  - Change some internal component-specific CSS variables to follow a naming pattern.
  - Make sure that forced light/dark appearance on the `Theme` component also sets the corresponding browser colors, like the correct input autofill background color.
  - Rename all `@keyframes` animations with `rt-` prefix and into kebab case.
  - Use `outline` rather than `box-shadow` for most focus styles, which avoids a slight anti-aliasing issue in Chrome on focused elements.
- `AlertDialog`, `Dialog`
  - Add padding around dialog content to prevent it from touching the viewport edges
  - Make sure that the dialog content doesn’t overflow viewport on iOS
- `Avatar`
  - Don’t enforce fallback icon size
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were using `svg` assets as a fallback, make sure to set an appropriate size manually.

    - `--cursor-button: default;`
    - `--cursor-checkbox: default;`
    - `--cursor-disabled: not-allowed;`

    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were using these classes for your custom components, update the class name used.

- `Callout`
  - Tweak how the layout works to allow nesting multiple `Callout.Text` elements within `Callout.Root`
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were relying on how `Callout.Root` happened to provide flex properties, change your layout to use a `Flex` component explicitly.
  - Fix an issue when the callout would inherit text color unless an explicit `color` prop was passed.

  - Improve `::selection` background color for `variant="solid"`

    - Adjust the layout styles so that `TextArea` behaves like a true `display: block` element, filling the available space horizontally.
    - The `style` and `className` are now forwarded to the wrapping `div` element. The `ref` and other props are still forwarded to the `textarea` itself.
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were overriding `TextArea` styles via `style`, `className`, or custom CSS that targets the related HTML nodes, make sure that your custom styles work as expected.
    - **[Upgrade guide]** If you were relying on the intrinsic width of `TextArea` set by the browser, make sure that your layout looks as expected.

  - Refine and normalise the look and feel of disabled and read-only states.
  - Fix a Safari bug when the text value would appear tinted in the disabled input.
  - Improve autofill styles.
- `TextField`
  - Reset `z-index` of the container to avoid potential stacking issues.
  - Refine padding values for a more balanced look.
    - Use `text-indent` instead of `padding-left` so that long values aren't truncated on the left when the cursor is at the end of the input.

  - Refine and normalise the look and feel of disabled and read-only states.
