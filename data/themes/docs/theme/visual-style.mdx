# Visual style

<Description>Visual properties and their impact on your theme.</Description>

## Panel background

The `panelBackground` setting controls the background effect applied to panelled elements such as cards and tables.

Passing the `translucent` value creates a subtle overlay effect on these elements.

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesPanelTranslucentExample />
</Box>

While `solid` is useful when you'd prefer to present information unobstructed.

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesPanelSolidExample />
</Box>

### Basic usage

By default, the root `Theme` panel background is `solid`. To set a different panel background pass it via the `panelBackground` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

```jsx line=1
<Theme __panelBackground__="translucent">
  <MyApp />
</Theme>
```

## Radius

The `radius` setting manages the radius factor applied to elements.

The resulting `border-radius` is contextual and differs depending on the component. For example, when set to `full`, a [Button](/themes/docs/components/button) becomes pill shaped while a [Checkbox](/themes/docs/components/checkbox) will never become fully rounded to prevent any confusion between it and a [Radio Group](/themes/docs/components/radio-group).

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesRadiusExample />
</Box>
