## Anatomy

The [Theme component](/themes/docs/components/theme) defines the overall visual look of your application, it can be customized by passing a minimal set of configuration options.

```jsx live=true
<Theme
  accentColor="cyan"
  grayColor="gray"
  panelBackground="solid"
  scaling="100%"
  radius="full"
>
  <ThemesVolumnControlExample />
</Theme>
```

A well tuned set of defaults is provided to get you started, but don’t be afraid to [play with all of the available options](/themes/components) to find the right visual style for your application.

{

  <Grid columns={{ initial: '1', xs: '2' }} my="6" gap="4">
      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Accent color"
        desc="The accent color is applied to primary buttons, links and interactive elements."
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Gray color"
        desc="Grays are typically used for borders, text and non-interactive elements."
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Panel background"
        desc="Panels can be set to use either a solid color, or apply a translucent effect."
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Radius"
        desc="Radius controls the amount of rounding to apply to UI elements."
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Appearance"
        desc="The color scheme of the theme (typcially referred to as light and dark mode)"
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Scaling"
        desc="The unform scaling applied to your UI across the entire theme."
      />
    </Grid>

}

## Variants

Variants are visual variations of a component, they are used to create visual hierarchies and communicate relative importance.

Each component offers a different set of variants though all are designed to be consistent and complimentary with each other.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
  <Button variant="solid">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
  <Button variant="soft">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
  <Button variant="ghost">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
</Flex>
```

Using a combination of component variants alongside customized theme settings allows you to create a multitude of unique looking interfaces.
