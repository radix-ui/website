# Dark mode

<Description>Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.</Description>

## Overview

Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or styling.

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesDarkModeExample />
</Box>

## Basic usage

By default, the root `Theme` appearance is `light`. To set a different appearance pass it via the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

```jsx line=1
<Theme __appearance__="dark">
  <MyApp />
</Theme>
```

### Automatic background color

Radix Themes will automatically set the background color of your app to match `appearance`, this is achieved by injecting a `background-color` style on the `body` element.

As the style injection can only occur on the client, you may experience a hydration warning. In this case it's safe to suppress the warning.

```jsx line=4
// app/layout.jsx
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html __suppressHydrationWarning__>
      <head />
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Inheriting from system preferences

A common requirement is to inherit the appearance setting from a users system preferences.

This is a deceptively complex problem to solve given SSR, SSG and client side hydration considerations. To make implementation easier, we recommend integrating with a theme switching library.

### With next-themes

Integration with `next-themes` is simple and straightforward because Radix Themes implements matching class names.

To enable dark mode, use `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`.

```jsx line=6
import { Theme } from '@radix-ui/themes';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';

export default function () {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      <Theme>
        <MyApp />
      </Theme>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

{

<Callout.Root my="5" highContrast>
  <Callout.Icon>
    <InfoCircledIcon />
  </Callout.Icon>
  <Callout.Text>
    Do <Strong>not</Strong> pass <Code variant="ghost">resolvedTheme</Code> from{' '}
    <Code variant="ghost">next-themes</Code> to{' '}
    <Code variant="ghost">appearance</Code>. Instead, rely just on the class
    switching. This is important so that{' '}
    <Code variant="ghost">next-themes</Code> can prevent the appearance flash
    during initial render.
  </Callout.Text>
</Callout.Root>

}

### With other libraries

Any library that supports class switching is compatible, you'll just need to ensure that the appended class names match those used by Radix Themes:

- `light`
- `dark`

or

- `light-theme`
- `dark-theme`
