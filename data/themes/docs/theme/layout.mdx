# Layout

<Description>Declarative layout and common spacing props.</Description>

## Spacing scale

Spacing values are derived from a 9 step scale.

<Box my="7">
  <ThemesSpacingScale />
</Box>

<ThemesSpacingTable />

## Layout components

[Box](/themes/docs/components/box), [Flex](/themes/docs/components/flex) and [Grid](/themes/docs/components/grid) are foundational elements you'll use to construct layouts. Box provides block-level spacing and sizing, while Flex and Grid let you create flexible columns, rows and grids.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns="3" gap="3">
  <Flex direction="column" gap="3">
    <Box height="5">
      <DecorativeBox />
    </Box>
    <Box height="7">
      <DecorativeBox />
    </Box>
    <Box height="9">
      <DecorativeBox />
    </Box>
  </Flex>
  <Flex direction="column" gap="3">
    <Box grow="1">
      <DecorativeBox />
    </Box>

    <Box height="6">
      <DecorativeBox />
    </Box>
  </Flex>
</Grid>
```

[Container](/themes/docs/components/container) and [Section](/themes/docs/components/section) are used for page level layout and allow you to contain the max width of content or apply consistent vertical spacing between sections.

All layout components share a common set of props:

<ThemesPropsTable name="layout" />

### Margin props

Shorthand utilities for applying margin to any side of an element, useful when you need to apply space between elements. Margin props are available on components that render a node.

```jsx live=true line=1
<Button __mr__="3" variant="soft">Cancel</Button>
<Button>Save changes</Button>
```

<ThemesPropsTable name="margin" />

### Scaling

Values which affect layout (spacing, typographic sizing, line heights) scale relatively based on the `scaling` value defined in your [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme). This setting allows you to scale the UI density uniformly across your entire application.

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesScalingExample />
</Box>
