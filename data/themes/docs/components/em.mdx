## API Reference

This component is based on the `em` element and supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).

<ThemesPropsTable defs="emPropDefs" />

## Examples

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
  <Em truncate>
    The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
    in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
    more pleasant.
  </Em>
</Flex>
```
