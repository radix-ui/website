<ThemesPropsTable defs="strongPropDefs" />

## Examples

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
	<Strong truncate>
		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
		more pleasant.
	</Strong>
</Flex>
```
