        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and “readable”
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.

        Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
        distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the
        quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance, if a “b”
        and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to distinguish at small
        sizes, this is a problem of legibility.

      <Text as="p">
        Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to
        select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font
        containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The
        selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using
        only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the ScrollArea primitive [Root](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#root) and [Viewport](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#viewport) parts. It supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/theme/layout#margin-props).

<ThemesPropsTable defs="scrollAreaPropDefs" />

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the scrollbar handles.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
  <ScrollArea
    size="1"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 300, height: 12 }}
  >
    <Box width="800px" height="1px" />
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea
    size="2"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 16 }}
  >
    <Box width="900px" height="1px" />
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 400, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box width="1000px" height="1px" />
  </ScrollArea>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius to the handles.

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
  <ScrollArea
    radius="none"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box width="800px" height="1px" />
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea
    radius="full"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box width="800px" height="1px" />
  </ScrollArea>
</Flex>
```

### Scollbars

Use the `scrollbars` prop to limit scrollable axes.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns="2" gap="2">
  <ScrollArea type="always" scrollbars="vertical" style={{ height: 150 }}>
    <Flex p="2" pr="8" direction="column" gap="4">
      <Text size="2" trim="both">
        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.
      </Text>

      <Text size="2" trim="both">
        Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
        distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as "the
        quality of being decipherable and recognisable". For instance, if a "b"
        and an "h", or a "3" and an "8", are difficult to distinguish at small
        sizes, this is a problem of legibility.
