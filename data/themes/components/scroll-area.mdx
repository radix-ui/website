        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.

        Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
        distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as "the
        quality of being decipherable and recognisable". For instance, if a "b"
        and an "h", or a "3" and an "8", are difficult to distinguish at small
        sizes, this is a problem of legibility. Typographers are concerned with
        legibility insofar as it is their job to select the correct font to use.
        Brush Script is an example of a font containing many characters that
        might be difficult to distinguish. The selection of cases influences the
        legibility of typography because using only uppercase letters (all-caps)
        reduces legibility.

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the scrollbar handles.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center" style={{ height: 150 }}>
  <ScrollArea size="1" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Flex direction="column" gap="4">
        <Text trim="both">
          Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability,
          and aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and
          "readable" are often used synonymously, typographically they are
          separate but related concepts
        </Text>
      </Flex>
    </Box>
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea size="2" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Text trim="both">
        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.
      </Text>
    </Box>
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea size="3" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Flex direction="column" gap="4">
        <Text trim="both">
          Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability,
          and aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and
          "readable" are often used synonymously, typographically they are

        </Text>
      </Flex>
    </Box>
  </ScrollArea>

```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius value to the scrollbar handles, ignoring the global theme.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center" style={{ height: 150 }}>
  <ScrollArea radius="none" size="3" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Text trim="both">
        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.
      </Text>
    </Box>
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea radius="medium" size="3" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Text trim="both">
        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.
      </Text>
    </Box>
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea radius="full" size="3" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Text trim="both">
        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable"
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.

    </Box>
  </ScrollArea>
</Flex>
```

### Scollbars

Use the `scrollbars` prop to limit scrollable axes.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center" style={{ height: 165 }}>
  <ScrollArea radius="none" type="always" scrollbars="vertical">
    <Box p="2" pr="8">
      <Flex direction="column" gap="4">
        <Text trim="both">
          Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability,
          and aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and
          "readable" are often used synonymously, typographically they are
          separate but related concepts.
